## Scene 0 — Partnership (Consolidated & Shortened)

**NARRATOR**: A run-down detective office. Dust on the desk. Someone's sleeping.

**KASTOR**: (snoring) "Zzzzz..."

[Door opens — Detective enters]

**DETECTIVE**: "...Is this the right place?"

**KASTOR**: (jolts awake) "Hm?" (stretches) "Oh! New recruit?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Starting as a detective today."

**KASTOR**: "Detective? You don't look like one."

**DETECTIVE**: "It's my first day!"

**KASTOR**: "Shows. It's written all over your face." (grins)

**DETECTIVE**: (This guy...)

**KASTOR**: "I'm Kastor! Your partner!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Nice to meet you... wait, what's your name again?"

**KASTOR**: "I just said it. Kastor."

**DETECTIVE**: "No, MY name."

**KASTOR**: "Oh~ YOUR name! What is it?"

[INPUT: Name]

**DETECTIVE**: "[Name]"

**KASTOR**: "Cool name! Spelled right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "I just typed it myself."

**KASTOR**: "Perfect! Name tags are non-refundable."

**DETECTIVE**: "What...?"

[Email notification — DING!]

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Mail!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Already?"

**KASTOR**: "Lucky you! No cases = boredom central. Click it!"

---

### 📧 Case Email

**FROM**: Maya Zhang (Director, Legend Arena)  
**SUBJECT**: URGENT! Need Help!

> Hello detectives!
> 
> Our character Shadow's win rate **jumped from 50% to 85% in ONE DAY**!
> 
> We didn't patch him! I have NO idea why this happened! 😰
> 
> The community is exploding! If we lose player trust, the game is finished!
> 
> PLEASE HELP US!

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Gaming case! Fun stuff!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Shadow suddenly got way stronger..."

**KASTOR**: "35% jump! That's insane!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Is that a lot?"

**KASTOR**: "Imagine... eating half a chicken, then suddenly eating THREE whole chickens."

**DETECTIVE**: "...What kind of analogy is that?"

**KASTOR**: "Didn't work? Okay, pizza then—"

**DETECTIVE**: "NO! I get it! It's a lot!"

**KASTOR**: (laughs) "See? Food analogies work!"

**DETECTIVE**: (Why food...)

---

## 🎮 Scene 1 — Gathering Data

**KASTOR**: "Alright! First quest! Form a hypothesis!"

**DETECTIVE**: "A hypothesis?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep. Detectives can't just guess randomly. We need a **starting theory** to guide our search."

**DETECTIVE**: "Like a direction?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Think of it like... choosing which door to open first in a mystery game."

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — Initial Hypothesis

**KASTOR**: "So! Three possibilities. Pick one based on Maya's email!"

**A) Official Patch (but undocumented)**  
→ Theory: Maybe the team DID patch Shadow but forgot to write it down?

**B) Rare Bug**  
→ Theory: Could be a random glitch that accidentally made Shadow stronger?

**C) Unauthorized Modification**  
→ Theory: Someone secretly changed Shadow's stats on purpose?

---

### [Player chooses C]

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Crime vibes! I like your thinking!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Just... a feeling."

**KASTOR**: "Detectives can't work on feelings alone~"

**DETECTIVE**: "Then what?"

**KASTOR**: "**DATA!** Numbers don't lie!"

**DETECTIVE**: "But people do?"

**KASTOR**: "All the time! That's why we check the evidence first. Let's call Maya!"

🎵 **MINI CELEBRATION** — Case accepted! +10 points

---

## 📞 Scene 2 — Call Maya

[Phone dialing sound]

**MAYA**: "Hello? Detectives?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yes. We got your email. Can you tell us everything?"

**MAYA**: "Shadow's win rate spiked on **Day 28**. We definitely didn't patch him. The community thinks we're lying!"

**KASTOR**: "Can you send us the game data? Patch notes, server logs, player statistics?"

**MAYA**: "Sending now! Please hurry — every hour we wait, we lose more players!"

**DETECTIVE**: "We'll figure this out."

---

## 📊 Scene 3 — Graph Analysis (Interactive)

**KASTOR**: "Data received! Let's open the **win rate graph**!"

[Interactive line graph appears — Three colored lines representing Shadow, Phoenix, and Viper]

**DETECTIVE**: "Whoa... the red line shoots straight up on Day 28."

**KASTOR**: "Like a rocket to space, right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Phoenix (blue line) also goes up a little..."

**KASTOR**: "But it's gentle — like climbing stairs. Shadow's line? That's an elevator."

---

### 🎯 Data Literacy Lesson #1: Reading Trends

**KASTOR**: "Quick lesson! When you see a graph like this, ask yourself:"

📌 **Which line changed the MOST?**  
📌 **Which line changed the FASTEST?**  
📌 **When exactly did it change?**

**DETECTIVE**: "So... Shadow changed the most AND the fastest, right on Day 28."

**KASTOR**: "Bingo! That's called **anomaly detection** — spotting the weird thing."

**DETECTIVE**: "Anomaly... I'll remember that."

**KASTOR**: "Good! Now, what should we check next?"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — What to investigate first?

**A) Check the official patch notes** (Did the team document any changes?)  
**B) Interview players immediately** (Maybe they know something?)  
**C) Look at server logs** (Raw technical data first?)

---

### [Player chooses A — Recommended path]

**KASTOR**: "Smart choice! Always check the **official records** first. It's like reading the instruction manual before taking apart a machine."

🎵 **MINI CELEBRATION** — +5 Investigation Points

## 📄 Scene 4 — Document Analysis

### Official Patch Notes — Day 28

```
LEGEND ARENA — Patch v2.8.1
Released: Day 28, 9:00 AM

CHANGES:
- Phoenix: Cooldown reduced by 2 seconds
- Viper: No changes
- Shadow: No changes

NOTES:
"We're monitoring Shadow's performance. No adjustments needed yet."
```

**DETECTIVE**: "It says 'Shadow: No changes'..."

**KASTOR**: "But the graph says different. Someone's lying — either the notes or the data."

**DETECTIVE**: "How do we know which one?"

**KASTOR**: "Server logs! Those are automatic records. They can't lie."

---

### 🖥️ Server Logs (Simplified View)

```
DAY 28 — ADMIN ACTIVITY LOG

19:15 — admin01 logged in (Office IP)
19:20 — admin01 viewed Shadow's data
19:45 — admin01 logged out

23:35 — admin01 logged in (Home IP) ⚠️
23:47 — admin01 MODIFIED Shadow's base stats ⚠️⚠️
23:52 — admin01 attempted to DELETE logs (FAILED) ⚠️⚠️⚠️
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Wait... there WAS a change! At 23:47!"

**KASTOR**: "And it's not in the official notes. Somebody went **off-script**."

**DETECTIVE**: "Who's admin01?"

**KASTOR**: "Let's ask Maya."

---

## 📞 Call Maya — Identity Check

**MAYA**: "admin01? That's **Kaito Nakamura**. He's a junior balance designer."

**DETECTIVE**: "Was he working overtime on Day 28?"

**MAYA**: (checking records) "No... he left the office at 6 PM. Why?"

**KASTOR**: "Because he logged in from HOME at 11:35 PM and modified Shadow."

**MAYA**: "WHAT?! That's not authorized! He needs approval for production changes!"

**DETECTIVE**: "And he tried to delete the logs."

**MAYA**: "This is... I can't believe Kaito would..."

**KASTOR**: "We need to look deeper. Send us the **authentication logs**."

---

## 🔐 Scene 5 — Tech Concept: Authentication Logs

**KASTOR**: "Okay, time for another quick lesson!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Do we have to?"

**KASTOR**: "Yes! Otherwise you won't understand what we're looking at."

---

### 📚 Data Literacy Lesson #2: Authentication Logs

**KASTOR**: "Think of authentication logs like a **security camera for computers**."

**They record:**
- 🕐 **WHEN** someone logged in
- 👤 **WHO** logged in (username)
- 📍 **WHERE** they logged in from (IP address)
- 📱 **WHAT** device they used (device fingerprint)
- ⚙️ **WHAT** they did (actions taken)

**DETECTIVE**: "So we can see exactly what Kaito did?"

**KASTOR**: "Not just what. We can see if it was REALLY Kaito, or someone pretending to be him."

**DETECTIVE**: "How?"

**KASTOR**: "Every device leaves a unique **fingerprint** — like how your fingerprint is unique. If the fingerprint matches Kaito's usual device, it's probably him. If not..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Someone stole his account!"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Let's check."

---

### 🔍 Authentication Logs — Detailed View

```
2025-10-28T23:35:00Z
→ SESSION START
→ User: admin01 (Kaito Nakamura)
→ IP: 203.0.113.45
→ Device Fingerprint: DFP:7a9c... ← Kaito's phone
→ Session ID: SED-ABC123

2025-10-28T23:47:02Z
→ ACTION: MODIFY character=Shadow
→ Field: base_stats (ATK +15, DEF +10)
→ Authorization: debug_token=DBG-3344 ⚠️
→ Session: SED-ABC123

2025-10-28T23:47:03Z
→ ACTION: ATTEMPT_CLEAR_LOGS
→ Result: FAILED (insufficient permissions)
→ Session: SED-ABC123

2025-10-28T23:50:03Z
→ PLAYER SESSION START
→ Username: Noctis
→ IP: 203.0.113.45 ← SAME IP!
→ Device Fingerprint: DFP:7a9c... ← SAME DEVICE!
→ Session ID: PLR-XYZ789
```

**DETECTIVE**: "The same IP and device fingerprint!"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! It's like finding the same phone at both the crime scene and the suspect's home."

---

### 🎯 Data Literacy Lesson #3: IP Addresses

**KASTOR**: "Let me explain what we just found."

**IP Address = Internet address**
- Think of it like your home address, but for computers
- Every device that connects to the internet gets one
- 203.0.113.45 is the address that both edited Shadow AND played the game

**Device Fingerprint = Digital fingerprint**
- A unique ID for each device (phone, computer, etc.)
- Like how your thumbprint is unique to you
- DFP:7a9c... is Kaito's phone's "fingerprint"

**DETECTIVE**: "So the same phone was used to change Shadow and then play as Noctis?"

**KASTOR**: "Bingo! Now we know it wasn't a hack. This was done by someone with access to Kaito's phone."

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito himself?"

**KASTOR**: "Most likely. But let's check the timeline to be sure."

---

## ⏰ Scene 6 — Timeline Reconstruction

**KASTOR**: "Let's put all the pieces in order!"

### 📅 Day 28 Timeline

```
[OFFICE HOURS]
19:15 — Kaito logs in at office
19:20 — Views Shadow's data (normal work)
19:45 — Logs out, leaves office

[EVENING — 4 hour gap]
(No activity recorded)

[LATE NIGHT]
23:35 — Kaito logs in from HOME
23:47 — Modifies Shadow's stats (+15 ATK, +10 DEF)
23:52 — Tries to delete logs (fails)
23:50 — Player "Noctis" starts playing
01:30 — Noctis logs off (88% win rate with Shadow!)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Wait... Noctis started playing THREE MINUTES after the modification?"

**KASTOR**: "And from the same device. That's not a coincidence."

**DETECTIVE**: "So Kaito changed Shadow, then immediately played with the buffed version?"

**KASTOR**: "Looks like it. But let's verify by talking to his manager."

---

## 📞 Scene 7 — Interview Lukas (Kaito's Manager)

**LUKAS**: "Kaito? He's a good kid. Hardworking, passionate about balance design."

**DETECTIVE**: "Did he ask for approval to modify Shadow on Day 28?"

**LUKAS**: "No. I checked the Shadow data myself at 10:30 PM that night. Everything looked normal."

**KASTOR**: "What if I told you he logged in from home at 11:35 PM and changed Shadow?"

**LUKAS**: "...Home? That doesn't make sense. Production changes require my approval. He knows that!"

**DETECTIVE**: "The logs don't lie."

**LUKAS**: (long pause) "I... I trusted him. This is really disappointing."

---

## 🎮 Scene 8 — Player Profile Analysis

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at who 'Noctis' is."

### Player Profile: Noctis

```
Account Age: 3 years
Main Character: Shadow (95% of games)
Rank: Diamond II
Recent Performance:
- Days 1-27: 48% win rate (average)
- Day 28: 88% win rate (!!!)
- Games played Day 28: 23:50 - 01:30
```

**DETECTIVE**: "His win rate DOUBLED on Day 28!"

**KASTOR**: "Right when Shadow got buffed. And look — Shadow is his main. He plays Shadow 95% of the time."

**DETECTIVE**: "So Kaito, who's a Shadow main as 'Noctis', secretly buffed Shadow and immediately played with it?"

**KASTOR**: "That's our theory. But we should check if there are other Shadow players who might be involved."

---

### Other Shadow Mains — Day 28 Activity

```
ShadowFan99:
- Online: 19:00 - 21:00 (BEFORE the buff)
- Win rate: 49% (normal)
- Different IP address

DarkShadow007:
- Offline on Day 28
- Last login: Day 26

ShadowMaster:
- Online: 14:00 - 16:00 (BEFORE the buff)
- Win rate: 51% (normal)
```

**KASTOR**: "Everyone else is normal. Only Noctis had a crazy spike."

**DETECTIVE**: "Because only Noctis knew about the buff!"

**KASTOR**: "Time to talk to Kaito."

---

## 🎭 Scene 9 — Confrontation with Kaito

[Video call with Kaito]

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito. We need to talk about Day 28."

**KAITO**: "Day 28? I worked on Phoenix that day."

**DETECTIVE**: "You also logged in from home at 11:35 PM."

**KAITO**: (shifts uncomfortably) "I... sometimes work from home."

**KASTOR**: "And modified Shadow at 11:47 PM. Without approval."

**KAITO**: "That's... I didn't..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Then you logged in as 'Noctis' at 11:50 PM. Same device. Same IP."

**KAITO**: (silence)

**KASTOR**: "Your win rate went from 48% to 88%. You won 20 games in a row with the Shadow you just buffed."

**DETECTIVE**: "The timeline matches. The device matches. The player data matches."

**KAITO**: (long pause) "I... I didn't mean for it to go this far."

---

### Kaito's Confession

**KAITO**: "I main Shadow. I've mained him for three years. I watch every tournament, read every forum post..."

**DETECTIVE**: "And?"

**KAITO**: "Everyone was saying Shadow is weak. That he needs buffs. I... I agreed. So I kept proposing changes to Lukas."

**KASTOR**: "But he kept rejecting them?"

**KAITO**: "He said the data didn't support it. That Shadow was 'balanced'. But I KNEW he wasn't! I could FEEL it when I played!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So you took matters into your own hands."

**KAITO**: "I just wanted to prove I was right! If Shadow performed better, Lukas would see that my proposal was correct all along!"

**KASTOR**: "But you didn't think about the other players. Or the company's reputation."

**KAITO**: (looks down) "I know. I messed up. I'm sorry."

---

## 📋 Scene 10 — Case Resolution

### Evidence Summary

✅ **Graph Analysis**: Shadow's win rate jumped 35% on Day 28  
✅ **Patch Notes**: No official Shadow changes documented  
✅ **Server Logs**: admin01 (Kaito) modified Shadow at 23:47  
✅ **Auth Logs**: Same device used for modification and gameplay  
✅ **Timeline**: 3-minute gap between modification and Noctis login  
✅ **Player Data**: Noctis (Kaito's account) had 88% win rate spike  
✅ **Confession**: Kaito admitted to unauthorized changes

---

### 🎯 What Kaito Did

1. **Logged in from home** using his admin account
2. **Modified Shadow's stats** without approval (+15 ATK, +10 DEF)
3. **Attempted to cover his tracks** by deleting logs (failed)
4. **Immediately played as Noctis** to test the changes
5. **Won 20 games in a row** with the buffed Shadow

---

### 💭 Motivation

**Primary**: Prove his balance proposals were correct  
**Secondary**: Win more games as his main character  
**Method**: Unauthorized use of developer access  
**Mistake**: Underestimated the impact and forgot logs can't be fully erased

---

## 🏢 Scene 11 — Recommend Outcomes

**MAYA**: "So... what should we do?"

**KASTOR**: "That's up to you. But here are three options:"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — Resolution Path

**Option A: Disciplinary Action + Process Improvement**
- Kaito receives formal warning or temporary suspension
- Implement two-factor authentication for production changes
- Require manager approval for all balance modifications
- Public announcement: "We identified and fixed an unauthorized change"

**Option B: Transparency + Rollback**
- Full public disclosure of what happened
- Immediate rollback of Shadow changes
- Kaito apologizes to community
- Rebuild trust through honesty

**Option C: Internal Resolution Only**
- Handle quietly within company
- Rollback changes without explanation
- Stricter access controls implemented
- Risk: Players might not trust the company's word

---

### [Player chooses Option B — Recommended path]

**MAYA**: "I think... we need to be honest with our players."

**KASTOR**: "Brave choice. Transparency builds trust."

**DETECTIVE**: "It's the right thing to do."

---

## 📢 Scene 12 — Aftermath

### Company Response (3 days later)

**LEGEND ARENA OFFICIAL STATEMENT**

> "Dear Players,
> 
> We owe you an explanation. Shadow's recent performance spike was caused by an unauthorized modification made by a team member acting alone. This was not an official patch, and it violated our internal protocols.
> 
> We have rolled back all changes and implemented stricter access controls. The team member involved has been disciplined and is receiving additional training on professional ethics.
> 
> We apologize for the confusion and lost trust. We're committed to being transparent with you moving forward.
> 
> Thank you for your patience.
> — Maya Zhang, Director"

---

### Character Reactions

**MAYA**: "It hurt to write that... but the community response has been mostly positive. They appreciate the honesty."

**LUKAS**: "I feel betrayed, but... I should have listened to Kaito's proposals more seriously. Maybe if I had, this wouldn't have happened."

**KAITO**: "I lost my chance to work on balance design for six months. But I deserved it. I learned that data and process exist for a reason."

**PLAYER (Diego/ShadowFan99)**: "Finally! An honest explanation. I can keep playing now."

---

## 🎉 Case Closed!
