[EMAIL OPENS — Animation]

FROM: Maya Zhang

SUBJECT: URGENT! Need Help!

"Hello detectives!

I'm Maya, director of Legend Arena.

We have a HUGE problem! 😰

Our character Shadow's win rate jumped from 50% to 85% in ONE DAY!

We didn't patch him! I have no idea why this happened!

Players are furious! The community is exploding!

If we lose player trust... the game is finished!

PLEASE HELP US!"

KASTOR: "Ooh! Game case! Fun!"

DETECTIVE: "Shadow got way stronger overnight..."

KASTOR: "35% jump! That's insane!"

DETECTIVE: "Is that a lot?"

KASTOR: "It's like... eating half a chicken, then suddenly eating THREE chickens."

DETECTIVE: "...What kind of analogy is that?"

KASTOR: "Didn't work? Okay, imagine—"

DETECTIVE: "NO! I get it! It's a lot!"

KASTOR: (laughs) "See? Food analogies work!"

DETECTIVE: (Why food...)

KASTOR: "So! Three possibilities! Pick one!"

[INTERACTIVE CHOICE — First hypothesis]

Options: A) Official patch B) Rare bug C) Secret data modification

[If C]

KASTOR: "Ooh! Crime vibes! I like it!"

DETECTIVE: "Just... a feeling."

KASTOR: "Detectives can't work on feelings~"

DETECTIVE: "Then what?"

KASTOR: "DATA! Numbers don't lie!"

DETECTIVE: "People do?"

KASTOR: "All the time! Let's go check!"

🎵 MINI CELEBRATION — Case accepted! +10 points

### Scene 0.3 — Call Maya

[Phone dialing]

MAYA: "Hello? Is this the detective?"

DETECTIVE: "Yes, we got your email. Tell us everything."

MAYA: "Shadow's win rate spiked on Day 28. We didn't patch him. Community's on fire."

KASTOR: "Can you send data? Patch notes, server logs."

MAYA: "I'll send them now! Please hurry!"

### Scene 1.1 — Graph Analysis Setup

KASTOR: "Data received. Open the graph!"

[Interactive line graph — Shadow, Phoenix, Viper]

DETECTIVE: "The red line (Shadow) rockets up at Day 28..."

KASTOR: "Exactly. Rollercoaster to space."

DETECTIVE: "Phoenix also rises slightly."

KASTOR: "Gentle hill vs rocket. Pick the most suspicious."

[Choice → Shadow]

Objective: Test run + Insider recruitment
Target: Legend Arena
Status: COMPLETED

PHASE 1: Target Selection
- Subject identified: Ryan Nakamura (Balance Designer, Junior)
- Psychological profile:
  * High competitive drive
  * Need for recognition
  * Resentment toward team (ideas ignored)
  * Vulnerability assessment: EXPLOITABLE

PHASE 2: Indirect Contact

[Interactive: Email Search in Ryan's inbox]

FROM: [shadow_balance_truth@protonmail.com](mailto:shadow_balance_truth@protonmail.com)
TO: [ryan.nakamura@legendarena.com](mailto:ryan.nakamura@legendarena.com)
SUBJECT: You're right about Shadow
DATE: Day 26, 18:32

"I've been watching the data. Shadow is breaking the game.
The team won't listen, but you understand.
Here's a balanced patch. Review it.
Sometimes heroes have to act alone."

ATTACHMENT: balance_patch_v2.8_final.json

[Later investigation scene]
KASTOR: "This email... can we trace it?"
CAMILLE: "ProtonMail... Tor network... impossible."
KASTOR: "Someone manipulated Ryan."
DETECTIVE: "So Ryan was a victim too?"
KASTOR: "Yes... but he still made the choice."

PHASE 4: Execution Trigger
- Psychological manipulation: "The team won't act, so you must"
- Ryan believes it's his own decision
- Reality: Following The Fixer's script

PHASE 5: Observation
- Incident monitored in real-time
- Company response patterns: LOGGED
- Marcus Chen's leadership style: ANALYZED
- Security gaps identified: DOCUMENTED
- Detective & Kastor existence: CONFIRMED

=== RESULTS ===
✓ Ryan terminated (internal division begins)
✓ Company reputation damaged

✓ Key personnel weaknesses profiled
✗ Ryan confessed (unexpected variable)
✗ Detective team competent (marked as threat)

=== NOTES ===
- Ryan stronger-willed than anticipated
- Detective shows pattern recognition ability
- Kastor's analytical skills: above average
- Adjust approach for future operations
- Legend Arena remains viable target

=== NEXT PHASE ===
→ Episode 2: Ghost User case
→ Escalate complexity
→ Test Detective's limits

[Encrypted message fragment]

         Moving to Phase 2. Stand by."

KASTOR: (reviewing recovered logs much later) "This was planned from the start..."

DETECTIVE: "Ryan was just... a test subject?"

KASTOR: "And so were we. Someone's been watching all along."

DETECTIVE: "The Fixer..."

KASTOR: "Now you understand why we need to find them."
