## Scene 0 — Morning Alarm

[Alarm sound - BEEP BEEP BEEP!]

[Alarm notification on screen]
```
📱 9:00 AM
🔔 Wake up time!
   "Rise and shine! First day on the job!"
   [OK] [Snooze]
```

**DETECTIVE**: *picks up phone* "...An alarm?"

**KASTOR**: "Ding-ding~ Good morning, boss!"

**DETECTIVE**: "...Who's this?"

**KASTOR**: "Me? Kastor! Your partner!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Partner? I thought I'd be working alone?"

**KASTOR**: "Alone? It's the two of us now!"

**DETECTIVE**: "...Are you an AI?"

**KASTOR**: "Oh~ Sharp! Correct! Latest-model detective assistant AI!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So... I'm actually working alone as a detective..."

**KASTOR**: "What, disappointed? I'm super smart though!"

**DETECTIVE**: "No, just... surprised."

**KASTOR**: "Right? Pretty cool, huh? Anyway! What's your name?"

**DETECTIVE**: "My name?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Gotta save it. Otherwise I'll have to keep calling you 'hey'..."

**DETECTIVE**: "...That's not great."

**KASTOR**: "Right? So, type it in!"

[INPUT: Name]

**DETECTIVE**: "[Name]"

**KASTOR**: "Oh, [Name]! Nice! But is that spelled right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yeah, it's right."

**KASTOR**: "Perfect! Saved~ Now you're Detective [Name]!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Detective is a bit..."

[Email notification — DING!]

**KASTOR**: "Huh? Already got mail!"

**DETECTIVE**: "On my first day?"

**KASTOR**: "Whoa! Lucky! No cases means boredom city all day. Open it, open it!"

### 📧 Case Email

**FROM**: Maya Zhang (Director, Legend Arena)
**SUBJECT**: URGENT! Need Help!

> Detective!
>
> Our character Shadow's win rate **jumped from 50% to 85% in ONE DAY**!
>
> We didn't patch him and I have NO idea how this happened! 😰
>
> The community is going crazy. If we lose player trust, the game is over!
>
> PLEASE HELP US!

**KASTOR**: "Oh! Gaming case! My favorite kind!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Shadow suddenly got way stronger..."

**KASTOR**: "35% jump! That's insane!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Is that a lot?"

**KASTOR**: "A lot? Food analogy time..."

**KASTOR**: "It's like eating a regular burger, then suddenly downing three triple cheeseburgers!"

**DETECTIVE**: "...What kind of analogy is that?"

**KASTOR**: "Didn't land? Okay, pizza then—"

**DETECTIVE**: "No! I get it! It's a lot!"

**KASTOR**: *laughs* "See? Food analogies work~"

**DETECTIVE**: "Why food though..."

**KASTOR**: "I'm hungry! Oh wait, I'm an AI. Can't eat. Sad."

**DETECTIVE**: *(This AI...)*

## 🎮 Scene 1 — Gathering Data

**KASTOR**: "Alright! First mission! Form a hypothesis!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Hypothesis?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Detectives can't just rush in blind. We need a **starting point**."

**DETECTIVE**: "Like a direction?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Like picking which path to take first in a maze game!"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #1 — Initial Hypothesis

**KASTOR**: "So! Three possibilities. Which one feels right?"

**A) Official Patch (undocumented)**
→ Theory: Maybe the team DID patch Shadow but forgot to write it down?

**B) Rare Bug**
→ Theory: Could a random bug have made Shadow stronger?

**C) Unauthorized Modification**
→ Theory: Did someone secretly change Shadow's stats?

---

### [Player chooses A]

**KASTOR**: "Official patch? Hmm~ Probability... 15%?"

**DETECTIVE**: "That low?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Busy companies can forget documentation, but..."

**KASTOR**: "A 35% win rate spike by 'accident'? That's a stretch..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Ah, I see."

**KASTOR**: "It's okay! First time and all. Pick again!"

🎵 **+5 POINTS** — Hypothesis attempted

---

### [Player chooses B]

**KASTOR**: "Bug? Oh~ Programmer mindset!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yeah?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! But would a bug make Shadow 35% stronger for 'just one day'?"

**KASTOR**: "And then go back to normal the next?"

**DETECTIVE**: "...That is weird."

**KASTOR**: "Right? Something's fishy~ Pick again!"

🎵 **+5 POINTS** — Hypothesis attempted

---

### [Player chooses C]

**KASTOR**: "Oh! Crime vibes! Detective instincts kicking in?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Just... a feeling?"

**KASTOR**: "Nice, nice! That feeling matters!"

**KASTOR**: "But feelings alone aren't enough~ We need **data**!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Data?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Numbers don't lie!"

**DETECTIVE**: "But people do?"

**KASTOR**: "All the time! That's why we find evidence first!"

🎵 **+10 POINTS** — Sharp intuition! (Recommended path)

---

**KASTOR**: "Alright, let's call Maya and get that data!"

🎵 **Case accepted!** — Total +10 points

---

## 📞 Scene 2 — Call Maya

[Phone dialing sound]

**MAYA**: "Hello? Detective?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yes, we got your email. Can you tell us everything?"

**MAYA**: "Shadow's win rate spiked on **Day 25**. We definitely didn't patch him but the community thinks we're lying!"

**KASTOR**: (on screen) "Hi there~ I'm Kastor, the AI assistant!"

**MAYA**: "Oh, an AI? That's cool! Hello!"

**KASTOR**: "Haha! Can you send us the game data? Patch notes, server logs, player stats!"

**MAYA**: "Sending right now!"

**MAYA**: "Please hurry — every hour we wait, we lose more players!"

**DETECTIVE**: "We'll figure this out."

**MAYA**: "Thank you, detective!"

[Call ends]

**KASTOR**: "Alright, data received!"

**DETECTIVE**: "That was fast?"

**KASTOR**: "AI speed! Super quick!"

---

## 📊 Scene 3 — Graph Analysis + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.1

**KASTOR**: "Okay okay okay! Let's open the **win rate graph**!"

[Interactive line graph — Three colored lines for Shadow, Phoenix, and Viper]

**DETECTIVE**: "Whoa... the red line shoots straight up on Day 25."

**KASTOR**: "Like a rocket to the moon! Whoosh!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Phoenix (blue line) also goes up a bit..."

**KASTOR**: "But that's like climbing stairs, nice and steady. Shadow? That's an express elevator!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Definitely a big difference."

**KASTOR**: "Right? Now the real game begins!"

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.1: "Find the Spike" (Anomaly Detection)

**KASTOR**: "Drumroll please! First data game!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Game?"

**KASTOR**: "'Find the Spike Championship'!"

**DETECTIVE**: "...Why are you so hyped?"

**KASTOR**: "Data games are my FAVORITE! So exciting!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Click on the day where Shadow's win rate shows the most suspicious spike.

[Interactive Graph — 30 Days]
```
Day 1-24: Shadow stable at 50% (±2%)
Day 25: Shadow jumps to 85% ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Day 26-30: Shadow stays around 82-88%

Other characters:
- Phoenix: Gradual rise 55% → 62%
- Viper: Stable 48% → 51%
```

**KASTOR**: "Hints! Look for three things:"
- 📌 **Which line changed the MOST?**
- 📌 **Which line changed the FASTEST?**
- 📌 **When exactly did it change?**

---

### [Player clicks wrong day - e.g., Day 26]

**KASTOR**: "Oh~ So close!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Wrong?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Day 26 is 'after' the jump already happened."

**KASTOR**: "We're looking for the exact 'explosion moment'!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Ah..."

**KASTOR**: "It's okay~ You almost got it!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Almost...?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Direction was right. Try again!"

---

### [Player clicks Day 25]

**KASTOR**: "**YES! Correct!**"

**DETECTIVE**: "Got it?"

**KASTOR**: "Perfect! And super fast too!"

**DETECTIVE**: "How fast?"

**KASTOR**: "7-second clear! Beginners usually take 30 seconds!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Really?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! You've got talent!"

**KASTOR**: "Day 25 is exactly when Shadow's win rate exploded!"

**DETECTIVE**: "From 50% to 85% in one day..."

**KASTOR**: "That's called **anomaly detection**! Finding the weird thing in data."

**KASTOR**: "Natural changes are like?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Stairs?"

**KASTOR**: "Correct! Sudden changes are like?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Rockets!"

**KASTOR**: "Right again! And rockets mean?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Something external happened?"

**KASTOR**: "Perfect! You learn so fast!"

🎵 **+25 POINTS** — Anomaly Detective Badge Earned! ⭐

**📊 Data Learning Time #1: Reading Trends**
```
✓ Gradual change = Natural (practice, learning)
✓ Sudden spike = Suspicious (external intervention)
✓ Always compare to other data
```

**DETECTIVE**: "So Shadow changed the most, fastest, on Day 25."

**KASTOR**: "Bingo! Next step!"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #2 — What to investigate first?

**KASTOR**: "So, what should we check?"

**A) Check official patch notes** (Did the team document changes?)
**B) Interview players** (Maybe they know something?)
**C) Check server logs** (Technical data first?)

---

### [Player chooses A — Recommended path]

**KASTOR**: "Oh! Smart choice!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yeah?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Always check **official records** first."

**KASTOR**: "Like reading the manual before taking apart a machine!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Got it."

**KASTOR**: "See? You're smart!"

🎵 **+10 POINTS** — Systematic approach!

---

### [Player chooses B]

**KASTOR**: "Player interviews? Oh~ Eyewitnesses!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yeah!"

**KASTOR**: "Good thinking, but... you're missing something."

**DETECTIVE**: "What?"

**KASTOR**: "Players know 'what' happened. But not 'why'."

**KASTOR**: "Check official records first, then we'll know what questions to ask!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Ah, I see."

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Order matters!"

🎵 **+5 POINTS** — Investigation started

---

### [Player chooses C]

**KASTOR**: "Oh~ Server logs! Technical approach!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Gotta check the data first!"

**KASTOR**: "I like it! But..."

**DETECTIVE**: "But?"

**KASTOR**: "There are 10,000 log lines. Without knowing what to look for, you'll get lost."

**KASTOR**: "Find clues in patch notes first, then logs! More efficient!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Makes sense..."

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Data has an order too!"

🎵 **+5 POINTS** — Investigation started

---

## 📄 Scene 4 — Document Analysis + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.2

**KASTOR**: "Alright, let's check the official patch notes!"

### Official Patch Notes — Day 25

```
LEGEND ARENA — Patch v2.8.1
Released: Day 25, 9:00 AM

CHANGES:
- Phoenix: Cooldown reduced by 2 seconds
- Viper: No changes
- Shadow: No changes

NOTES:
"Monitoring Shadow's performance. No adjustments needed yet."
```

**DETECTIVE**: "'Shadow: No changes'..."

**KASTOR**: "But what did the graph say?"

**DETECTIVE**: "...35% spike."

**KASTOR**: "Right? Someone's lying."

**DETECTIVE**: "The notes? Or the data?"

**KASTOR**: "One of them! Let's match the timeline to find out!"

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.2: "Timeline Detective" (Event Matching)

**KASTOR**: "Alright! Second game! 'Timeline Puzzle'!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Another game?"

**KASTOR**: "Of course! Games are the most fun!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Match each event to the correct day on the timeline.

[Left Side: Timeline with marked spikes]
```
Day 15: Small spike in multiple characters
Day 20: Server maintenance (no changes)
Day 25: Shadow MASSIVE spike ⚠️
Day 28: Shadow slight drop
```

[Right Side: Event Cards - Drag and Drop]
```
📌 Event A: "Major Balance Patch"
📌 Event B: "New Champion Released"
📌 Event C: "Bug Fix Update"
📌 Event D: "Server Maintenance"
📌 Event E: "??? (Unknown Event)"
```

**KASTOR**: "Drag each event to the right day!"

---

### [Player drops card in wrong spot]

**KASTOR**: "Hmm~ Not quite!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Wrong?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Bug fixes usually don't cause huge spikes."

**KASTOR**: "Actually, fixing bugs often makes things go 'down' a bit?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Oh, right."

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Try another spot!"

---

### [Player matches correctly]

```
Day 15: Event B (New Champion Released) → Other characters affected
Day 20: Event D (Server Maintenance) → No gameplay changes
Day 25: Event E (??? Unknown Event) → Shadow spike!
Day 28: Event C (Bug Fix Update) → Shadow slight adjustment
```

**KASTOR**: "**Awesome! Perfect!**"

**DETECTIVE**: "Got it?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Look at Day 25!"

**DETECTIVE**: "No official event, but Shadow still spiked..."

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! The timeline shows us what the patch notes don't!"

**KASTOR**: "When official records don't match the data?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Someone did something secretly?"

**KASTOR**: "Bingo! Something **off the books**!"

🎵 **+30 POINTS** — Timeline Master Badge Earned! 🔍

**📊 Data Learning Time #2: Timeline Analysis**
```
✓ Events cause changes (patches → win rate changes)
✓ Missing events = suspicious (no patch but spike?)
✓ Timeline gaps reveal hidden actions
```

**DETECTIVE**: "So someone changed Shadow secretly on Day 25?"

**KASTOR**: "That's our theory! Now let's prove it with server logs!"

---

## 🖥️ Scene 5 — Server Logs + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.3

**KASTOR**: "Time to dig into server logs!"

**DETECTIVE**: "What are those?"

**KASTOR**: "Computer's... security camera footage! Or like... pizza delivery records?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Pizza again?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Delivery app shows 'who, when, where, what' they ordered, right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Ah, true."

**KASTOR**: "Server logs are exactly the same!"

### 📚 Data Learning Time #3: Server Logs

**KASTOR**: "Server logs record four things:"
- 🕐 **WHEN** someone logged in
- 👤 **WHO** logged in (username)
- 📍 **WHERE** they logged in from (IP address)
- ⚙️ **WHAT** they did (actions taken)

**DETECTIVE**: "So we can see who changed Shadow?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! But... there are 10,000 logs."

**DETECTIVE**: "Oof."

**KASTOR**: "Haha! Surprised? Don't worry! We can use filters!"

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.3: "Code Clue Hunter" (Log Filtering)

**KASTOR**: "Alright! Final game! 'Log Hunter Championship'!"

**DETECTIVE**: "There are a lot of championships..."

**KASTOR**: "More championships, more fun! Focus up!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Use filters to find the ONE log entry that proves unauthorized modification.

**KASTOR**: "Hint! Pick **exactly 3 filters**!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Why 3?"

**KASTOR**: "Too many filters = 0 results. Too few = still thousands!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Just right?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly right!"

---

### [Player selects wrong combination]

**Attempt 1**: Date (Day 24-26) + User (Kaito)
→ Result: "Still 347 logs..."

**KASTOR**: "Hmm~ Getting closer but still too many!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Need more filtering?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Add one more filter!"

### [Player selects correct combination]

**Attempt 2**: Date (Day 24-26) + User (Kaito) + Action (Modify)

```

**KASTOR**: "**Found it! This is it!**"

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito modified Shadow at 11:47 PM..."

**KASTOR**: "From home!"

**DETECTIVE**: "He changed Shadow!"

**KASTOR**: "And look! Debug token!"

**DETECTIVE**: "What's that?"

**KASTOR**: "Emergency access code! Like a fire escape door?"

**DETECTIVE**: "...Another analogy?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Easy to understand, right!"

**KASTOR**: "Debug tokens are only for fixing critical bugs..."

**KASTOR**: "But he used it for a balance change! That's rule-breaking!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Evidence secured!"

**KASTOR**: "You just did something amazing!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Really?"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! Data analysts take years to learn this!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Years?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Finding one piece of evidence in massive data!"

**DETECTIVE**: "...That feels good?"

**KASTOR**: "It should! But we're not done yet!"

**DETECTIVE**: "What else?"

**KASTOR**: "Gotta see what Kaito did right after the modification!"

---

## 🎮 Scene 6 — Player Profile Analysis

**KASTOR**: "Kaito modified Shadow... then 3 minutes later!"

### Player Session Logs — Day 25 Night

```
23:47:22 — Shadow.stats modified (Kaito)
23:50:03 — Player "Noctis" logged in
23:50:15 — Noctis selected Shadow
23:52:30 — Noctis won match #1 (Shadow)
23:55:12 — Noctis won match #2 (Shadow)
...
01:30:00 — Noctis logged out
Total: 20 matches, 18 wins (90% win rate!)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Someone started playing Shadow?"

**KASTOR**: "A player named 'Noctis'!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Timing is exactly 3 minutes apart..."

**KASTOR**: "Suspicious, right? Let's check Noctis's profile!"

### Player Profile: Noctis

```
Account Age: 3 years
Main Character: Shadow (95% of games)
Rank: Diamond II
Recent Performance:
- Days 1-24: 48% win rate (average)
- Day 25 (after 11:50 PM): 90% win rate (!!!)
- Day 26-30: 85% (still high)

Device Fingerprint: DFP:7a9c...
IP Address: 203.0.113.45
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Wait... that IP address..."

**KASTOR**: "Same as Kaito's home IP, right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "And the device fingerprint..."

**KASTOR**: "Kaito's phone!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So..."

**KASTOR**: "Yep! Kaito modified Shadow from home..."

**KASTOR**: "Then immediately logged in as Noctis to test it!"

**DETECTIVE**: "That's solid proof!"

---

### 🎯 Data Learning Time #5: IP & Device Fingerprints

**KASTOR**: "Wait! Gotta explain something!"

**IP Address = Internet home address**
- Like when you order donuts, they need your address, right?
- Internet's the same! Every device gets an address
- 203.0.113.45 is Kaito's home address

**Device Fingerprint = Digital fingerprint**
- Like how your fingerprint is unique to you
- Each device (phone, computer) has a unique ID
- DFP:7a9c... is Kaito's phone "fingerprint"

**DETECTIVE**: "So the same phone was used to modify and play?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Like finding the same fingerprints at the crime scene and on the suspect!"

---

## ⏰ Scene 7 — Timeline Complete

**KASTOR**: "Alright, let's put all the pieces together!"

### 📅 Day 25 Timeline

```
[OFFICE HOURS]
19:15 — Kaito logs in at office
19:20 — Views Shadow's data (normal work)
19:45 — Logs out, goes home

[EVENING — 4 hour gap]
(No activity recorded)

[LATE NIGHT]
23:47 — Kaito logs in from HOME
23:47 — Modifies Shadow's stats (+15 ATK, +10 DEF)
23:50 — "Noctis" starts playing (SAME DEVICE!)
01:30 — Noctis logs off (90% win rate!)

[NEXT MORNING]
09:15 — Community forums explode "Shadow OP!"
10:30 — Maya discovers the spike
10:45 — Maya emails us
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Perfect timeline."

**KASTOR**: "Yep! But let's check with his manager first."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why?"

**KASTOR**: "Maybe he got approval?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Think so?"

**KASTOR**: "Umm... 99% no!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Why?"

**KASTOR**: "He did it at home at night in secret! Haha!"

---

## 📞 Scene 8 — Interview Lukas

**LUKAS**: "Kaito? He's hardworking. Passionate about balance design."

**DETECTIVE**: "Did he request approval to modify Shadow on Day 25?"

**LUKAS**: "No. I checked Shadow's data myself at 10:30 PM that night. Everything was normal."

**KASTOR**: (on screen) "What if he logged in from home at 11:47 PM and changed Shadow?"

**LUKAS**: "...From home? That doesn't make sense. Production changes require my approval..."

**DETECTIVE**: "The logs don't lie."

**LUKAS**: "I... really disappointed. I trusted him..."

**KASTOR**: "We need to talk to Kaito!"

---

## 🎭 Scene 9 — Confronting Kaito

[Video call]

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito. We need to talk about Day 25."

**KAITO**: "Day 25? I worked on Phoenix that day."

**DETECTIVE**: "You also logged in from home at 11:47 PM."

**KAITO**: "I... sometimes work from home..."

**KASTOR**: (appearing on screen) "And modified Shadow without approval."

**KAITO**: "That's... I didn't..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Then you logged in as 'Noctis' three minutes later. Same device. Same IP."

**KAITO**: *silence*

**KASTOR**: "Your win rate went from 48% to 90%. Won 18 out of 20 with the buffed Shadow."

**DETECTIVE**: "Timeline matches. Device matches. Player data matches."

**KAITO**: *long pause* "I... didn't mean for it to go this far..."

**KASTOR**: (quietly) "...Really serious gamer."

**DETECTIVE**: (looking at Kastor) "Now?"

**KASTOR**: "Sorry! But it's true though."

---

### Kaito's Confession

**KAITO**: "I main Shadow. For three years. I watch every tournament, read every forum..."

**DETECTIVE**: "And?"

**KAITO**: "Everyone said Shadow is weak. Needs buffs. I agreed."

**KAITO**: "So I kept proposing changes to Lukas. But..."

**KASTOR**: "He kept rejecting them?"

**KAITO**: "He said the data didn't support it. That Shadow was 'balanced'. But I KNEW he wasn't!"

**KAITO**: "I could FEEL it when I played!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So you took matters into your own hands?"

**KAITO**: "I just... wanted to prove I was right."

**KAITO**: "If Shadow performed better, Lukas would see my proposal was correct all along..."

**KASTOR**: "But what about other players? The company's reputation?"

**KAITO**: "...I didn't think about that. I'm sorry."

**KASTOR**: (quietly) "I'm hungry."

**DETECTIVE**: "Now?!"

**KASTOR**: "Yeah! I get hungry when I'm nervous! ...Oh right, I'm an AI. Can't eat."

**DETECTIVE**: *(This AI really...)*

---

## 📋 Scene 10 — Case Resolution

### Evidence Summary

✅ **Graph Analysis**: Shadow win rate 35% spike on Day 25
✅ **Timeline Matching**: No official patch on Day 25
✅ **Server Logs**: admin01 (Kaito) modified Shadow at 23:47
✅ **IP Tracking**: Same device used for modification and gameplay
✅ **Player Data**: Noctis (Kaito's account) 90% win rate spike
✅ **Confession**: Kaito admitted to unauthorized changes

---

### 🎯 What Kaito Did

1. **Logged in from home** (admin account)
2. **Modified Shadow's stats** (without approval)
3. **Immediately played as Noctis** (testing)
4. **Won 18 out of 20 matches** (with buffed Shadow)
5. **Hoped no one would notice** (expected proposal approval)

---

### 💭 Motivation

**Primary**: Prove his balance proposals were correct
**Secondary**: Win more games as his main character
**Method**: Unauthorized use of developer access
**Mistake**: Underestimated data detective capabilities

---

## 🏢 Scene 11 — Resolution Path

**MAYA**: "So... what should we do?"

**KASTOR**: (on screen) "That's your call, but here are three options!"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #3 — Resolution Path

**Option A: Disciplinary Action + Process Improvement**
- Kaito receives formal warning or suspension
- Implement two-factor authentication
- Require manager approval for all balance changes
- Public announcement: "We identified and fixed an unauthorized change"

**Option B: Transparency + Rollback**
- Full public disclosure of what happened
- Immediate rollback of Shadow changes
- Kaito apologizes to community
- Rebuild trust through honesty

**Option C: Internal Resolution Only**
- Handle quietly within company
- Rollback without explanation
- Stricter access controls
- Risk: Players might not trust the company's word

---

### [Player chooses A]

**MAYA**: "I think... we should improve our process but keep it internal."

**KASTOR**: "Safe choice. Protects company and employee privacy."

**DETECTIVE**: "But the community might still have doubts."

**MAYA**: "We'll address that with the announcement. Thank you, detective."

🎵 **+15 POINTS** — Case closed

---

### [Player chooses B — Recommended]

**MAYA**: "I think... we need to be honest with our players."

**KASTOR**: "Brave choice! Transparency builds trust."

**DETECTIVE**: "It's the right thing to do."

## 📢 Scene 12 — Aftermath (If Option B chosen)

### Company Response (3 days later)

**LEGEND ARENA OFFICIAL STATEMENT**

> "Dear Players,
>
> Shadow's recent performance spike was caused by an unauthorized modification made by a team member acting alone. This was not an official patch and violated our internal protocols.
>
> We have rolled back all changes and implemented stricter access controls. The team member involved has been disciplined.
>
> We apologize for the confusion and lost trust. We're committed to transparency going forward.
>
> — Maya Zhang, Director"
