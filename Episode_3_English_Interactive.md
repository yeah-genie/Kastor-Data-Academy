## Scene 0 — Opening

**[Detective Office - Morning]**

**KASTOR**: *reading newspaper* "Quite the upset."

**DETECTIVE**: "What is?"

**KASTOR**: "Dark Horses won the Legend Arena Championship. 3-0 sweep."

**DETECTIVE**: "Are they strong?"

**KASTOR**: "Unknown team. But they crushed Phoenix Rising — the tournament favorites."

**DETECTIVE**: "Maybe they're just really good?"

**KASTOR**: "Maybe..." *looks suspicious*

[Email notification — DING!]

**FROM**: Marcus Chen (CTO, Legend Arena)
**SUBJECT**: Urgent - Tournament Investigation Needed

> Detectives,
>
> Our first official tournament just ended.
>
> Dark Horses won 3-0 against Phoenix Rising.
>
> The community is calling it match-fixing.

> After Kaito and Elena... we can't afford another scandal.
>
> Please investigate.

**KASTOR**: "Here we go again."

**DETECTIVE**: "Third time at Legend Arena..."

**KASTOR**: "Third time's the charm. Let's solve this one for good."

🎵 **NEW CASE** — +10 points

## Scene 1 — Legend Arena HQ

**[Conference Room - Marcus, Maya, Kaito, Camille]**

**MARCUS**: "Thank you for coming. The finals were... wrong."

**MAYA**: "Phoenix trained for three months. They won 10 straight matches in qualifiers."

**MAYA**: "Then in the finals? 0-3. Complete domination."

**KAITO**: "I watched the matches. Phoenix played like beginners."

**DETECTIVE**: "Could they just have had a bad day?"

**CAMILLE**: "Not this bad. Look at the data."

[Camille presents graph]

```
Phoenix Rising Performance (40 Days):
Day 1-37: Steady 70-75% win rate
Day 38: Small dip to 68%
Day 39: Drop to 55%
Day 40 (Finals): Crash to 0%
```

**KASTOR**: "That's not a performance dip. That's a cliff."

**MARCUS**: "Exactly. Something happened between Day 37 and Day 40."

**DETECTIVE**: "What changed?"

**MAYA**: "Dark Horses hired a new coach. Harrison Webb. Day 38."

**KASTOR**: "Tell us about Harrison."

---

## Scene 2 — Harrison Webb Profile

**MARCUS**: "Harrison Webb. 45 years old. British. 15 years coaching esports."

**MARCUS**: "He's worked for multiple teams. Never won a championship... until now."

**DETECTIVE**: "So he finally got his win?"

**KAITO**: "Maybe. But the timing is suspicious."

**KAITO**: "Joins Day 38. Finals on Day 40. Two days."

**KAITO**: "In two days, he made Dark Horses unbeatable?"

**KASTOR**: "Or he had an advantage Phoenix didn't."

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at the player reactions first."

## Scene 3 — Jake Interview (Phoenix Captain)

[Phone call with Jake "Blaze" Morrison]

**JAKE**: "We... we trained for three months."

**JAKE**: "Twelve hours a day. Strategy, teamwork, everything."

**JAKE**: "We won ten straight! We were unstoppable!"

**DETECTIVE**: "What happened in the finals?"

**JAKE**: *voice breaks* "...Something was wrong."

**JAKE**: "My hands didn't feel like my own. Skills wouldn't fire. Timing was off..."

**JAKE**: "All my teammates felt the same. Like we were lagging."

**KASTOR**: "Lagging? Network issues?"

**JAKE**: "We thought so. But our ping was normal. 20ms like always."

**DETECTIVE**: "And Dark Horses?"

**JAKE**: *angry* "They were PERFECT!"

**JAKE**: "Every move we made, they countered instantly. Like they knew what we'd do before we did it!"

**KASTOR**: "Describe 'perfect.'"

**JAKE**: "...Like they had a script. No hesitation. No mistakes. Robotic."

**DETECTIVE**: "That doesn't sound human."

**JAKE**: *crying now* "It wasn't fair! We worked so hard... Please prove it wasn't our fault. Please."

## Scene 4 — Data Analysis + 🎮 MINI-GAME 3.1

**[Back at office]**

**KASTOR**: "Time to dig into the data. We have 40 days of tournament history."

**DETECTIVE**: "That's a lot..."

**KASTOR**: "Which is why we need YOUR pattern recognition skills!"

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 3.1: "Bet Spike Detective" (Betting Pattern Analysis)

**KASTOR**: "First, let's look at the betting data. Luna Park — the betting platform operator — sent us the records."

**🎯 Your Mission**: Find the days when betting patterns became suspicious. Mark any anomalies!

[Interactive Dual Graph Display - 40 Days]

**Graph 1 (Top): Phoenix Rising Betting Volume**
```
Day 1-37: Stable $70K-90K per day (heavy favorites)
Day 38: Drops to $60K
Day 39: Drops to $45K
Day 40 (Finals Eve): Drops to $30K ⚠️
```

**Graph 2 (Bottom): Dark Horses Betting Volume**
```
Day 1-37: Stable $3K-8K per day (underdogs)
Day 38: Jumps to $25K ⚠️
Day 39: Jumps to $40K ⚠️
Day 40 (Finals Eve): Jumps to $60K ⚠️⚠️⚠️
```

**KASTOR**: "Look for the moment when the patterns reversed!"

[Player clicks on Day 38, 39, and 40]

**KASTOR**: "EXACTLY! Day 38 is when everything flipped!"

**Detailed Analysis - Day 38:**
```
BEFORE Day 38:
- Phoenix: 80% of all bets ($80K average)
- Dark Horses: 5% of all bets ($5K average)
- Odds: Phoenix 1.2x, Dark Horses 8.0x

AFTER Day 38:
- Day 38: Phoenix 60%, Dark Horses 25%
- Day 39: Phoenix 45%, Dark Horses 40%
- Day 40: Phoenix 30%, Dark Horses 60% (REVERSED!)
- Final Odds: Phoenix 2.5x, Dark Horses 1.5x
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Someone knew the outcome was changing!"

**KASTOR**: "Not just someone. Let's see WHO was betting..."

🎵 **+30 POINTS** — Bet Analyst Badge Earned! 📈

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #1: Inverse Correlation**
```
When two variables move in opposite directions = inverse correlation

Phoenix bets ↓ while Dark Horses bets ↑ = coordinated
This doesn't happen naturally!

Natural betting:
- Gradual shifts based on performance
- Both favorites get bets

Insider betting:
- Sudden dramatic shifts
- Money moves before performance changes
- Someone knows something
```

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 3.2: "Account Tracker" (Following the Money)

**KASTOR**: "Luna sent us detailed betting account data. 450 accounts, $455,000 total volume."

**🎯 Your Mission**: Find the suspicious betting accounts. Look for patterns that don't belong!

[Spreadsheet Display - 450 Accounts]

**Normal Account Examples:**
```
Account: RichKing_2024
Amount: $5,000
Date: Day 30
Team: Phoenix Rising
Pattern: Small bet early, on the favorite
Profile: Regular gambler, diversified bets

Account: CasualGamer88
Amount: $500
Date: Day 35
Team: Phoenix Rising
Pattern: Small recreational bet
Profile: First-time tournament better
```

**Suspicious Account Examples:**
```
Account: Account_F7743
Amount: $50,000 ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Date: Day 38 ⚠️
Team: Dark Horses ⚠️
Pattern: HUGE bet, right when patterns shifted
Profile: NEW account, only this one bet

Account: Account_F9521
Amount: $30,000 ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Date: Day 39 ⚠️
Team: Dark Horses ⚠️
Pattern: Large bet, continuing the pattern
Profile: NEW account, only this one bet
```

**KASTOR**: "Filter the data! Find accounts that match these criteria:"

**Suspicious Criteria Checklist:**
```
□ Account name starts with "F" or generic pattern
□ Bet placed Day 38 or later
□ Betting on Dark Horses (against the favorite)
□ Amount over $20,000
□ New account (created within days of bet)
```

[Player applies filters...]

**Results - 10 Accounts Found:**
```
1. Account_F7743: $50,000 (Day 38)
2. Account_F9521: $30,000 (Day 39)
3. Account_F3318: $75,000 (Day 38)

8. Account_F2234: $50,000 (Day 39)
9. Account_F7712: $35,000 (Day 40)
10. Account_F5529: $35,000 (Day 38)

TOTAL: $455,000 bet on Dark Horses
All accounts: Day 38-40
All accounts: "F" prefix pattern
All accounts: NEW (created Day 37-38)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "They all start with 'F'!"

**KASTOR**: "Just like Episode 2... CodeMaster_X used 'F-' accounts to steal data."

**KASTOR**: "And now 'F-' accounts are betting $455,000 on an underdog."

**DETECTIVE**: "Is it the same person?"

**KASTOR**: "Let's check the IP addresses..."

**[IP Trace Results]**
```
All 10 accounts:
- IP: VPN (rotating, untraceable)
- Payment: Cryptocurrency (mixed through tumblers)
- Email: Disposable (auto-deleted)
- Location: Changes every hour
```

**KASTOR**: "Professional work. Same as Episode 2."

**DETECTIVE**: "But WHY? What's the connection to match-fixing?"

**KASTOR**: "If you KNOW the outcome... you can bet on the underdog and win big."

**KASTOR**: "Let's calculate the profit..."

**Profit Calculation:**
```
Total Bet: $455,000 on Dark Horses
Dark Horses Odds (Day 38): 8.0x → 1.5x (final)
Average Odds: 3.5x

Profit: $455,000 × 3.5 = $1,592,500
Minus Initial: $1,592,500 - $455,000 = $1,137,500 profit

ROI: 250%
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Over a million dollars profit?!"

**KASTOR**: "If you rig the match."

🎵 **+45 POINTS** — Money Trail Hunter Badge Earned! 💰

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #2: Money Trail Analysis**
```
Following money reveals motives:

1. Large bets = High confidence (insider knowledge?)
2. Timing = Placed right after key event (Harrison joins)
3. Account patterns = Coordinated (same prefix, same timing)
4. Profit motive = $1.1M reason to fix the match
```

## Scene 5 — Alex Interview (Dark Horses Player)

[Video call with Alex "Shadow" Torres]

**ALEX**: "Hello? ...Wait—"

**DETECTIVE**: "Alex!"

**ALEX**: "Detective?! Oh wow... It's been so long!"

**KASTOR**: "You two know each other?"

**DETECTIVE**: "We met during Episode 2 — the Ghost User case!"

**ALEX**: "Thanks to your help... I went pro! I'm on Dark Horses now!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Congratulations! That's amazing!"

**ALEX**: *smile fades* "...This is about the finals, isn't it?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yes."

**ALEX**: "I... I thought something was wrong too."

**DETECTIVE**: "What do you mean?"

**ALEX**: "It was too easy."

**ALEX**: "Phoenix is the strongest team. Jake is legendary."

**ALEX**: "Me beating them 3-0... doesn't make sense."

**KASTOR**: "What happened during the matches?"

**ALEX**: "Coach Harrison gave us a strategy. Said 'just follow it exactly.'"

**ALEX**: "The strategy was... perfect. TOO perfect."

**ALEX**: "He predicted everything Phoenix would do. Every rotation, every attack, every defensive position."

**DETECTIVE**: "How could he know that?"

**ALEX**: "...I don't know. But two days ago, I saw him on a call."

**ALEX**: "I only saw the screen for a second. There was a message from someone with 'F' in the name."

**ALEX**: "It looked encrypted. Lots of code."

**KASTOR**: "F again..."

**ALEX**: "Am I... in trouble? If it was match-fixing and I was on the team..."

**DETECTIVE**: "You didn't know, Alex. You're fine."

**ALEX**: "Thank you..." *relieved* "You helped me in Episode 2, and now again."

**ALEX**: "I just want to play fair, you know?"

**DETECTIVE**: "We know. We'll get to the bottom of this."

## Scene 6 — Harrison Interview

[Phone call with Coach Harrison Webb]

**HARRISON**: "Good afternoon, detectives."

**DETECTIVE**: "Coach Webb, congratulations on your first championship."

**HARRISON**: "Thank you. Hard work pays off, you see."

**KASTOR**: "You joined Dark Horses on Day 38. Two days before the finals."

**HARRISON**: "Correct. They needed a coach. I was available, you see."

**DETECTIVE**: "How did you prepare the team so quickly?"

**HARRISON**: "Experience, you see. I analyzed Phoenix's past matches."

**KASTOR**: "All of them?"

**HARRISON**: "Forty matches. I know what to look for, you see."

**DETECTIVE**: "In two days?"

**HARRISON**: "Efficiency. Pattern recognition. You see, Phoenix has predictable rotations."

**KASTOR**: "Alex said your strategy predicted everything Phoenix would do."

**HARRISON**: *brief pause* "...Pattern analysis, you see."

**KASTOR**: "The betting odds shifted dramatically after you joined."

**HARRISON**: "Did they? I don't follow betting markets, you see."

**DETECTIVE**: "You don't find that coincidental?"

**HARRISON**: "Circumstantial, detective. Merely circumstantial, you see."

**KASTOR**: *after call* "He said 'you see' twelve times in three minutes."

**DETECTIVE**: "Verbal tic?"

**KASTOR**: "Or nervous tell. But he's too smooth. Everything's an excuse."

**KASTOR**: "We need hard evidence."

## Scene 7 — The Smoking Gun

**[Camille's Security Lab]**

**CAMILLE**: "I found something. Harrison's phone records."

**CAMILLE**: "He was sloppy. Left his work phone connected to our network."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did you find?"

**CAMILLE**: "Encrypted messages. Partially recovered."

**[Decrypted Messages - 37% Recovery]**

```
MESSAGE 1 (Day 38, 03:00 AM):
FROM: F-PRIME
TO: [HARRISON_DEVICE]

"Stage is set."
"$250,000 transferred. Check wallet."
"Phoenix data attached."
"Do not disappoint me."

MESSAGE 2 (Day 39, 03:00 AM):
FROM: F-PRIME
TO: [HARRISON_DEVICE]

"Remember the rules:"
"No evidence. No contact. No mercy."
"Win, and you get the rest."

MESSAGE 3 (Day 40, 03:15 AM):
FROM: F-PRIME
TO: [HARRISON_DEVICE]

"Watching the finals now."
"Performance: Flawless."
"However... you left patterns."
"F-accounts were sloppy."
"Contract terminated."
"No second payment."
```

**DETECTIVE**: "F-PRIME... The same person from Episode 2!"

**KASTOR**: "Same timing too. 03:00 AM. Every time."

**KASTOR**: "This person hired Harrison, paid him $250K, gave him Phoenix data..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Phoenix data? How?"

**CAMILLE**: "I checked. It's from the backdoor Elena installed in Episode 2."

**CAMILLE**: "40 matches of Phoenix data. Every strategy, every weakness, every pattern."

**DETECTIVE**: "So F-PRIME:"
- Used Elena to plant a backdoor (Episode 2)
- Stole Phoenix data through that backdoor
- Gave the data to Harrison
- Bet $455K knowing Harrison would win
- Made $1.1M profit

**KASTOR**: "And Harrison didn't just outsmart Phoenix. He had their entire playbook."

## Scene 8 — Final Piece + 🎮 MINI-GAME 3.3

**KASTOR**: "We have all the pieces. Now we need to put them in order."

**DETECTIVE**: "How?"

```

[Player completes the timeline correctly!]

**KASTOR**: "PERFECT! Now you see the whole picture!"

**The Complete Scheme:**

**Phase 1 - Data Theft (Episode 2 Callback):**
```
1. F-PRIME manipulates Elena to install backdoor
2. Backdoor gives access to all game data
3. F-PRIME steals 40 matches of Phoenix strategies
4. This was the REAL goal of Episode 2!
```

**Phase 2 - Setup (Day 37-38):**
```
5. F-PRIME finds Harrison (desperate for his first championship)
6. Offers $500K ($250K upfront, $250K after win)
7. Gives Harrison stolen Phoenix data
8. Harrison joins Dark Horses Day 38
```

**Phase 3 - Betting (Day 38-40):**
```
9. F-PRIME creates 10 betting accounts ("F" prefix)
10. Bets $455K on Dark Horses (huge underdog)
11. Betting markets shift, odds change
12. Planned profit: $1.1M+ (250% ROI)
```

**Phase 4 - Execution (Day 40 Finals):**
```
13. Harrison uses Phoenix playbook to counter everything
14. Phoenix can't adapt (Harrison knows all their moves)
15. Dark Horses wins 3-0 (perfectly executed)
16. F-PRIME makes $1.1M profit from bets
```

**Phase 5 - Betrayal (Post-Match):**
```
17. F-PRIME terminates Harrison's contract
18. Harrison never gets 2nd $250K payment
19. F-PRIME disappears
20. Harrison left holding the evidence
```

**DETECTIVE**: "This was planned from Episode 2?!"

**KASTOR**: "The backdoor wasn't about ghost users. It was about stealing data for THIS."

**KASTOR**: "F-PRIME played the long game. Three months. Three episodes."

🎵 **+60 POINTS** — Master Detective Badge Earned! 🧩

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #3: Connecting Multiple Data Sources**
```
Complex crimes require synthesizing:
1. Timeline data (when things happened)
2. Network data (who talked to who)
3. Financial data (money movements)
4. Technical data (backdoors, IP addresses)
5. Behavioral data (patterns, anomalies)

When you connect all sources → complete picture emerges!

## Scene 9 — Confrontation & Arrest

**[Harrison Webb - Arrested]**

**DETECTIVE**: "Harrison Webb, you're under arrest for match-fixing and fraud."

**HARRISON**: *drops the smooth act* "...You have no proof."

**KASTOR**: "We have:"
- Encrypted messages from F-PRIME
- $250K payment to your cryptocurrency wallet
- Phoenix data on your devices (stolen via backdoor)
- Betting records showing $455K placed by your employer
- Alex's testimony about your 'too perfect' strategy

**HARRISON**: *long silence*

**HARRISON**: "I never meant... I just wanted one championship. One."

**HARRISON**: "Fifteen years. Fifteen years of coaching. Never good enough."

**HARRISON**: "Then F-PRIME offered me a way. I... I took it."

**DETECTIVE**: "Did you know it was wrong?"

**HARRISON**: "...Yes. But I was desperate."

**KASTOR**: "Who is F-PRIME?"

**HARRISON**: "I don't know. Never saw a face. Never heard a real voice. Just encrypted messages."

**HARRISON**: "They knew everything. Phoenix data, betting systems, how to avoid detection..."

**HARRISON**: "This wasn't amateur hour. This was professional."

**KASTOR**: "And they betrayed you."

**HARRISON**: *bitter laugh* "No second payment. Contract terminated. I was just a tool."

## Scene 10 — Resolution

**[Legend Arena - Press Conference]**

**MARCUS**: "After thorough investigation, we've determined that Coach Harrison Webb engaged in match-fixing using stolen data."

**MARCUS**: "The Legend Arena Championship results are voided."

**MARCUS**: "Phoenix Rising is declared the rightful champion."

**MARCUS**: "We're implementing new security measures to prevent future incidents."

**[Community Response]**
```
Forum Post #1: "Finally! We knew Phoenix couldn't lose like that!"
Forum Post #2: "Three scandals in three months... can we trust Legend Arena?"
Forum Post #3: "At least they're being transparent. That counts for something."
```

## Scene 11 — The Pattern

**[Detective Office - Evening]**

EPISODE 2: Elena
- Manipulated by CodeMaster_X
- Installed backdoor

- Professional execution
- Victims manipulated then abandoned
```

**KASTOR**: "It's all connected. One person. Escalating each time."

**DETECTIVE**: "Testing us?"

**KASTOR**: "Or testing the system. Each episode, they learn more."

**KASTOR**: "Episode 1: Can we manipulate an insider?"
**KASTOR**: "Episode 2: Can we steal data?"
**KASTOR**: "Episode 3: Can we profit from it?"

**DETECTIVE**: "What's Episode 4?"

**KASTOR**: "I don't know. But they're not done."

**KASTOR**: "F-PRIME is still out there. With $1.1M profit. And all the knowledge from three successful operations."

**DETECTIVE**: "How do we catch them?"

**KASTOR**: "By doing what they don't expect."

**KASTOR**: "They think they're the hunter. Time to show them they're the prey."

You've learned to think like a data detective, spot patterns others miss, and solve complex mysteries using nothing but data and logic.

Remember: **Data doesn't lie. But people do. Your job is to find the truth hidden in the numbers.**

🎓 **Congratulations, Detective!**
