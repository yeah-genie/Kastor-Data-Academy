## Scene 0 — Partnership (Consolidated & Shortened)

**NARRATOR**: A run-down detective office. Dust on the desk. Someone's sleeping.

**KASTOR**: "Zzzzz..."

[Door opens — DETECTIVE enters]

**DETECTIVE**: "...Is this the right place?"

**KASTOR**: "Hm?" *stretches* "Oh! New recruit?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Starting as a detective today."

**KASTOR**: "Detective? You don't look like one."

**DETECTIVE**: "It's my first day!"

**KASTOR**: "Shows. It's written all over your face." *grins*

**DETECTIVE**: *(This guy...)*

**KASTOR**: "I'm Kastor! Your partner!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Nice to meet you... wait, what's your name again?"

**KASTOR**: "I just said it. Kastor."

**DETECTIVE**: "No, MY name."

**KASTOR**: "Oh~ YOUR name! What is it?"

[INPUT: Name]

**DETECTIVE**: "[Name]"

**KASTOR**: "Cool name! Spelled right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "I just typed it myself."

**KASTOR**: "Perfect! Name tags are non-refundable."

**DETECTIVE**: "What...?"

[Email notification — DING!]

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Mail!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Already?"

**KASTOR**: "Lucky you! No cases = boredom central. Click it!"

### 📧 Case Email

**FROM**: Maya Zhang (Director, Legend Arena)
**SUBJECT**: URGENT! Need Help!

> Hello detectives!
>
> Our character Shadow's win rate **jumped from 50% to 85% in ONE DAY**!
>
> We didn't patch him! I have NO idea why this happened! 😰
>
> The community is exploding! If we lose player trust, the game is finished!
>
> PLEASE HELP US!

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Gaming case! Fun stuff!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Shadow suddenly got way stronger..."

**KASTOR**: "35% jump! That's insane!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Is that a lot?"

**KASTOR**: "Imagine... eating half a chicken, then suddenly eating THREE whole chickens."

**DETECTIVE**: "...What kind of analogy is that?"

**KASTOR**: "Didn't work? Okay, pizza then—"

**DETECTIVE**: "NO! I get it! It's a lot!"

**KASTOR**: "See? Food analogies work!" *laughs*

**DETECTIVE**: *(Why food...)*

---

## 🎮 Scene 1 — Gathering Data

**KASTOR**: "Alright! First quest! Form a hypothesis!"

**DETECTIVE**: "A hypothesis?"

**KASTOR**: "Yep. Detectives can't just guess randomly. We need a **starting theory** to guide our search."

**DETECTIVE**: "Like a direction?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Think of it like... choosing which door to open first in a mystery game."

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — Initial Hypothesis

**KASTOR**: "So! Three possibilities. Pick one based on Maya's email!"

**A) Official Patch (but undocumented)**
→ Theory: Maybe the team DID patch Shadow but forgot to write it down?

**B) Rare Bug**
→ Theory: Could be a random glitch that accidentally made Shadow stronger?

**C) Unauthorized Modification**
→ Theory: Someone secretly changed Shadow's stats on purpose?

---

### [Player chooses C]

**KASTOR**: "Ooh! Crime vibes! I like your thinking!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Just... a feeling."

**KASTOR**: "Detectives can't work on feelings alone, though~"

**DETECTIVE**: "Then what?"

**KASTOR**: "**DATA!** Numbers don't lie!"

**DETECTIVE**: "But people do?"

**KASTOR**: "All the time! That's why we check the evidence first. Let's call Maya!"

🎵 **MINI CELEBRATION** — Case accepted! +10 points

---

## 📞 Scene 2 — Call Maya

[Phone dialing sound]

**MAYA**: "Hello? Detectives?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Yes. We got your email. Can you tell us everything?"

**MAYA**: "Shadow's win rate spiked on **Day 28**. We definitely didn't patch him. The community thinks we're lying!"

**KASTOR**: "Can you send us the game data? Patch notes, server logs, player statistics?"

**MAYA**: "Sending now! Please hurry — every hour we wait, we lose more players!"

**DETECTIVE**: "We'll figure this out."

---

## 📊 Scene 3 — Graph Analysis + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.1

**KASTOR**: "Data received! Let's open the **win rate graph**!"

[Interactive line graph appears — Three colored lines representing Shadow, Phoenix, and Viper]

**DETECTIVE**: "Whoa... the red line shoots straight up on Day 28."

**KASTOR**: "Like a rocket to space, right?"

**DETECTIVE**: "Phoenix (blue line) also goes up a little..."

**KASTOR**: "But it's gentle — like climbing stairs. Shadow's line? That's an elevator."

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.1: "Find the Spike" (Anomaly Detection)

**KASTOR**: "Okay! Time for your first data challenge!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Click on the day where Shadow's win rate shows the most suspicious spike.

[Interactive Graph Display - 30 Days]
```
Day 1-24: Shadow stable at 50% (±2%)
Day 25: Shadow jumps to 85% ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Day 26-30: Shadow stays around 82-88%

Other characters:
- Phoenix: Gradual rise 55% → 62%
- Viper: Stable 48% → 51%
```

**KASTOR**: "Remember what you're looking for:"
- 📌 **Which line changed the MOST?**
- 📌 **Which line changed the FASTEST?**
- 📌 **When exactly did it change?**

[Player clicks on Day 25]

**KASTOR**: "**PERFECT!** Day 25 is exactly when Shadow's win rate exploded!"

**DETECTIVE**: "It jumped from 50% to 85% in ONE day!"

**KASTOR**: "That's called **anomaly detection** — spotting the weird thing in data."

**KASTOR**: "Natural improvement looks like stairs."

**KASTOR**: "Sudden changes look like rockets."

**KASTOR**: "And rockets mean something external happened!"

🎵 **+25 POINTS** — Anomaly Detective Badge Earned! ⭐

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #1: Reading Trends**
```
✓ Gradual change = Natural (practice, learning)
✓ Sudden spike = Suspicious (external intervention)
✓ Always compare to other data (other characters stayed normal)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "So Shadow changed the most AND the fastest, right on Day 25."

**KASTOR**: "Bingo! Now, what should we check next?"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — What to investigate first?

**A) Check the official patch notes** (Did the team document any changes?)
**B) Interview players immediately** (Maybe they know something?)
**C) Look at server logs** (Raw technical data first?)

---

### [Player chooses A — Recommended path]

**KASTOR**: "Smart choice! Always check the **official records** first. It's like reading the instruction manual before taking apart a machine."

🎵 **MINI CELEBRATION** — +5 Investigation Points

## 📄 Scene 4 — Document Analysis + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.2

### Official Patch Notes — Day 25

```
LEGEND ARENA — Patch v2.8.1
Released: Day 25, 9:00 AM

CHANGES:
- Phoenix: Cooldown reduced by 2 seconds
- Viper: No changes
- Shadow: No changes

NOTES:
"We're monitoring Shadow's performance. No adjustments needed yet."
```

**DETECTIVE**: "It says 'Shadow: No changes'..."

**KASTOR**: "But the graph says different. Someone's lying — either the notes or the data."

**DETECTIVE**: "How do we know which one?"

**KASTOR**: "We need to match the timeline! Let's play detective!"

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.2: "Timeline Detective" (Event Matching)

**KASTOR**: "Time to connect the dots!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Match each event to the correct day on the timeline.

[Left Side: Timeline with marked spikes]
```
Day 15: Small spike in multiple characters
Day 20: Server maintenance (no changes)
Day 25: Shadow MASSIVE spike ⚠️
Day 28: Shadow slight drop
```

[Right Side: Event Cards - Drag and Drop]
```
📌 Event A: "Major Balance Patch"
📌 Event B: "New Champion Released"
📌 Event C: "Bug Fix Update"
📌 Event D: "Server Maintenance"
📌 Event E: "??? (Unknown Event)"
```

**KASTOR**: "Drag each event to where it belongs on the timeline!"

[Player starts matching...]

**KASTOR**: "Hmm, Bug Fix usually doesn't cause huge spikes. Try another spot!"

[Player matches correctly]
```
Day 15: Event B (New Champion Released) → Other characters affected
Day 20: Event D (Server Maintenance) → No gameplay changes
Day 25: Event E (??? Unknown Event) → Shadow spike!
Day 28: Event C (Bug Fix Update) → Shadow slight adjustment
```

**KASTOR**: "EXCELLENT! Look at Day 25!"

**DETECTIVE**: "There's no official event, but Shadow spiked anyway?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! The timeline shows us what the patch notes don't!"

**KASTOR**: "When official records don't match the data..."

**KASTOR**: "Someone did something **off the books**!"

🎵 **+30 POINTS** — Timeline Master Badge Earned! 🔍

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #2: Timeline Analysis**
```
✓ Events cause changes (patches affect win rates)
✓ Missing events are suspicious (no patch = no spike?)
✓ Timeline gaps reveal hidden actions
```

**DETECTIVE**: "So someone changed Shadow secretly on Day 25?"

**KASTOR**: "That's our theory! Now let's prove it with server logs!"

---

## 🖥️ Scene 5 — Server Logs + 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.3

**KASTOR**: "Time to dig into the server logs!"

**DETECTIVE**: "What are those?"

**KASTOR**: "Think of it like... security camera footage for computers."

### 📚 Data Literacy Lesson #3: Server Logs

**KASTOR**: "Server logs record everything that happens on a server:"
- 🕐 **WHEN** someone logged in
- 👤 **WHO** logged in (username)
- 📍 **WHERE** they logged in from (IP address)
- ⚙️ **WHAT** they did (actions taken)

**DETECTIVE**: "So we can see who changed Shadow?"

**KASTOR**: "If we look carefully enough, yes! But there are 10,000 log entries..."

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 1.3: "Code Clue Hunter" (Log Filtering)

**KASTOR**: "Time for the ultimate data detective challenge!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Use filters to find the ONE log entry that proves unauthorized modification.

[Log Screen - Scrolling view with 10,000 lines]

**KASTOR**: "You need to pick **exactly 3 filters** to narrow down to the smoking gun!"

**KASTOR**: "Too many filters = 0 results. Too few = still thousands of logs!"

[Player selects filters...]

**Attempt 1**: Date (Day 24-26) + User (Kaito)
→ Result: "Still 347 logs... too many! Add one more filter!"

**Attempt 2**: Date (Day 24-26) + User (Kaito) + Action (Modify)
→ Result: **1 log found!** ✅

```
🔍 EVIDENCE FOUND:

2025-01-25T23:47:22Z
User: admin01 (Kaito Nakamura)
Action: MODIFY
Target: Shadow.base_stats
Changes: ATK +15, DEF +10
IP Address: 203.0.113.45 (HOME IP, not office!)
Authorization: debug_token=DBG-3344 ⚠️
```

**KASTOR**: "THERE IT IS! The smoking gun!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito modified Shadow at 11:47 PM... from home?!"

**KASTOR**: "And look — he used a debug token. That's an emergency access code!"

**KASTOR**: "Debug tokens are for fixing critical bugs, NOT for balance changes!"

**DETECTIVE**: "This is the proof!"

🎵 **+35 POINTS** — Data Filter Expert Badge Earned! 💾

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson #4: Data Filtering**
```
✓ Filters narrow down big data (10,000 → 1)
✓ AND logic: All conditions must be true
✓ Finding the exact combination = detective skill!
```

**KASTOR**: "You just did what takes data analysts years to learn!"

**KASTOR**: "Filtering massive datasets to find ONE piece of evidence!"

**DETECTIVE**: "But wait... let me check something else..."

**KASTOR**: "What?"

**DETECTIVE**: "If Kaito changed Shadow at 11:47 PM..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Did anyone play Shadow right after?"

---

## 🎮 Scene 6 — Player Profile Analysis

**KASTOR**: "Good thinking! Let's check game sessions after the modification!"

### Player Session Logs — Day 25 Night

```
23:47:22 — Shadow.stats modified (Kaito)
23:50:03 — Player "Noctis" logged in
23:50:15 — Noctis selected Shadow
23:52:30 — Noctis won match #1 (Shadow)
23:55:12 — Noctis won match #2 (Shadow)
...
01:30:00 — Noctis logged out
Total: 20 matches played, 18 wins (90% win rate!)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "THREE MINUTES after Kaito modified Shadow, someone named Noctis started playing?"

**KASTOR**: "And won 18 out of 20 games with Shadow!"

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at Noctis's profile..."

### Player Profile: Noctis

```
Account Age: 3 years
Main Character: Shadow (95% of games)
Rank: Diamond II
Recent Performance:
- Days 1-24: 48% win rate (average)
- Day 25 (after 11:50 PM): 90% win rate (!!!)
- Day 26-30: Returns to 85% (still boosted)

Device Fingerprint: DFP:7a9c...
IP Address: 203.0.113.45
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Wait... that IP address..."

**KASTOR**: "Same as Kaito's home IP!"

**DETECTIVE**: "And the device fingerprint?"

**KASTOR**: "Also matches Kaito's phone!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So Kaito modified Shadow from home, then immediately logged in as Noctis to test it?"

**KASTOR**: "That's exactly what happened!"

---

### 🎯 Data Literacy Lesson #5: IP Addresses & Device Fingerprints

**KASTOR**: "Let me explain what we just found."

**IP Address = Internet address**
- Think of it like your home address, but for computers
- Every device that connects to the internet gets one
- 203.0.113.45 is the address that both edited Shadow AND played the game

**Device Fingerprint = Digital fingerprint**
- A unique ID for each device (phone, computer, etc.)
- Like how your thumbprint is unique to you
- DFP:7a9c... is Kaito's phone's "fingerprint"

**DETECTIVE**: "So the same phone was used to change Shadow and then play as Noctis?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! It's like finding the same fingerprints at a crime scene and on the suspect."

---

## ⏰ Scene 7 — Timeline Reconstruction

**KASTOR**: "Let's put all the pieces in order!"

### 📅 Day 25 Timeline

```
[OFFICE HOURS]
19:15 — Kaito logs in at office
19:20 — Views Shadow's data (normal work)
19:45 — Logs out, leaves office

[EVENING — 4 hour gap]
(No activity recorded)

[LATE NIGHT]
23:47 — Kaito logs in from HOME
23:47 — Modifies Shadow's stats (+15 ATK, +10 DEF)
23:50 — Player "Noctis" starts playing (SAME DEVICE!)
01:30 — Noctis logs off (90% win rate with Shadow!)

[NEXT MORNING]
09:15 — Community forums explode with "Shadow OP!" posts
10:30 — Maya discovers the spike
10:45 — Maya emails detectives
```

**DETECTIVE**: "The timeline is perfect. Kaito did this."

**KASTOR**: "But let's verify by talking to his manager before we accuse him."

---

## 📞 Scene 8 — Interview Lukas (Kaito's Manager)

**LUKAS**: "Kaito? He's a good kid. Hardworking, passionate about balance design."

**DETECTIVE**: "Did he ask for approval to modify Shadow on Day 25?"

**LUKAS**: "No. I checked the Shadow data myself at 10:30 PM that night. Everything looked normal."

**KASTOR**: "What if I told you he logged in from home at 11:47 PM and changed Shadow?"

**LUKAS**: "...Home? That doesn't make sense. Production changes require my approval. He knows that!"

**DETECTIVE**: "The logs don't lie."

**LUKAS**: "I... I trusted him. This is really disappointing."

**KASTOR**: "We need to talk to Kaito."

---

## 🎭 Scene 9 — Confrontation with Kaito

[Video call with Kaito]

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito. We need to talk about Day 25."

**KAITO**: "Day 25? I worked on Phoenix that day."

**DETECTIVE**: "You also logged in from home at 11:47 PM."

**KAITO**: "I... sometimes work from home."

**KASTOR**: "And modified Shadow without approval."

**KAITO**: "That's... I didn't..."

**DETECTIVE**: "Then you logged in as 'Noctis' three minutes later. Same device. Same IP."

**KAITO**: *silence*

**KASTOR**: "Your win rate went from 48% to 90%. You won 18 out of 20 games with the Shadow you just buffed."

**DETECTIVE**: "The timeline matches. The device matches. The player data matches."

**KAITO**: *long pause* "I... I didn't mean for it to go this far."

---

### Kaito's Confession

**KAITO**: "I main Shadow. I've mained him for three years. I watch every tournament, read every forum post..."

**DETECTIVE**: "And?"

**KAITO**: "Everyone was saying Shadow is weak. That he needs buffs. I... I agreed. So I kept proposing changes to Lukas."

**KASTOR**: "But he kept rejecting them?"

**KAITO**: "He said the data didn't support it. That Shadow was 'balanced'. But I KNEW he wasn't! I could FEEL it when I played!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So you took matters into your own hands."

**KAITO**: "I just wanted to prove I was right! If Shadow performed better, Lukas would see that my proposal was correct all along!"

**KASTOR**: "But you didn't think about the other players. Or the company's reputation."

**KAITO**: "I know. I messed up. I'm sorry."

---

## 📋 Scene 10 — Case Resolution

### Evidence Summary

✅ **Graph Analysis (Mini-Game 1)**: Shadow's win rate jumped 35% on Day 25
✅ **Timeline Matching (Mini-Game 2)**: No official patch on Day 25
✅ **Server Logs (Mini-Game 3)**: admin01 (Kaito) modified Shadow at 23:47
✅ **IP Tracking**: Same device used for modification and gameplay
✅ **Player Data**: Noctis (Kaito's account) had 90% win rate spike
✅ **Confession**: Kaito admitted to unauthorized changes

---

### 🎯 What Kaito Did

1. **Logged in from home** using his admin account
2. **Modified Shadow's stats** without approval (+15 ATK, +10 DEF)
3. **Immediately played as Noctis** to test the changes
4. **Won 18 out of 20 games** with the buffed Shadow
5. **Hoped no one would notice** and his proposal would be approved

---

### 💭 Motivation

**Primary**: Prove his balance proposals were correct
**Secondary**: Win more games as his main character
**Method**: Unauthorized use of developer access
**Mistake**: Underestimated data detective capabilities

---

## 🏢 Scene 11 — Resolution Path

**MAYA**: "So... what should we do?"

**KASTOR**: "That's up to you. But here are three options:"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice — Resolution Path

**Option A: Disciplinary Action + Process Improvement**
- Kaito receives formal warning or temporary suspension
- Implement two-factor authentication for production changes
- Require manager approval for all balance modifications
- Public announcement: "We identified and fixed an unauthorized change"

**Option B: Transparency + Rollback**
- Full public disclosure of what happened
- Immediate rollback of Shadow changes
- Kaito apologizes to community
- Rebuild trust through honesty

**Option C: Internal Resolution Only**
- Handle quietly within company
- Rollback changes without explanation
- Stricter access controls implemented
- Risk: Players might not trust the company's word

---

### [Player chooses Option B — Recommended path]

**MAYA**: "I think... we need to be honest with our players."

**KASTOR**: "Brave choice. Transparency builds trust."

**DETECTIVE**: "It's the right thing to do."

---

## 📢 Scene 12 — Aftermath

### Company Response (3 days later)

**LEGEND ARENA OFFICIAL STATEMENT**

> "Dear Players,
>
> We owe you an explanation. Shadow's recent performance spike was caused by an unauthorized modification made by a team member acting alone. This was not an official patch, and it violated our internal protocols.
>
> We have rolled back all changes and implemented stricter access controls. The team member involved has been disciplined and is receiving additional training on professional ethics.
>
> We apologize for the confusion and lost trust. We're committed to being transparent with you moving forward.
>
> Thank you for your patience.
> — Maya Zhang, Director"

---

### Character Reactions

**MAYA**: "It hurt to write that... but the community response has been mostly positive. They appreciate the honesty."

**LUKAS**: "I feel betrayed, but... I should have listened to Kaito's proposals more seriously. Maybe if I had, this wouldn't have happened."

**KAITO**: "I lost my chance to work on balance design for six months. But I deserved it. I learned that data and process exist for a reason."
