**Maya**: "Thanks for coming. It's... it's getting worse."

**Maya**: "Community's in chaos. Players are quitting."

**Kaito**: (enters) "Hey! Good to see you again!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Kaito! You're back?"

**KASTOR**: "Good. We need all hands on deck. Show us the ghost accounts."

---

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #1: Real vs. Fake Accounts

**Maya**: (pulls up profile) "This is GhostKing_947."

**Profile Display:**
```
Username: GhostKing_947
Account Age: 3 months
Games Played: 47
Win Rate: 98%
Friends: 0
Profile Picture: Default
Last Online: 2 hours ago
```

**KASTOR**: "47 games, 98% win rate. That's suspicious."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why? Maybe they're just good?"

**KASTOR**: "Let me show you a REAL top player."

**Normal Top Player Profile:**
```
Username: ProGamer_OG
Account Age: 3 years
Games Played: 12,847
Win Rate: 67%
Friends: 342
Profile Picture: Custom
Last Online: Now
```

**KASTOR**: "See the difference?"

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #1 — Spot the Differences

**Which differences are most suspicious?**

**A)** Account age (3 months vs. 3 years)  
**B)** Win rate (98% vs. 67%)  
**C)** Number of friends (0 vs. 342)  
**D)** All of the above

---

### [Player chooses D — Correct!]

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Let me explain why ALL of these matter."

**📌 Red Flag #1: Account Age**
- New accounts usually have LOWER win rates (learning period)
- 98% win rate in 3 months = suspicious skill jump

**📌 Red Flag #2: Win Rate**
- Even pros have 60-70% win rates
- 98% suggests either cheating OR not playing real opponents

**📌 Red Flag #3: Social Connections**
- Real players make friends, join communities
- Zero friends = account probably not social/real

**DETECTIVE**: "So these accounts are... what? Bots?"

**KASTOR**: "Maybe. Let's check their behavior patterns."

## Scene 2 — Behavior Patterns

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at when these ghost accounts play."

---

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #2: Login Patterns

**[Interactive Graph — Login Times]**

**Normal Player Login Times:**
```
[Graph showing random spikes throughout day]
- 7 AM: Some logins (before school/work)
- 12 PM: Lunch break spike
- 3-5 PM: After school
- 8-11 PM: Peak gaming time
- Pattern: IRREGULAR, follows human routines
```

**Ghost Account Login Times:**
```
[Graph showing perfect 3-hour intervals]
- 3:00 AM: Login
- 6:00 AM: Login
- 9:00 AM: Login
- 12:00 PM: Login
- Pattern: EXACTLY every 3 hours, like clockwork
```

**DETECTIVE**: "They log in every three hours? Exactly?"

**KASTOR**: "Down to the same SECOND."

**Kaito**: "That's... not human."

**KASTOR**: "Humans are messy. We don't do things at exactly the same time every day."

**Maya**: "So these are definitely bots?"

**KASTOR**: "Let's check one more thing. Session length."

---

### 📊 Session Duration Analysis

**KASTOR**: "How long do these accounts stay online?"

**Normal Players:**
- Session 1: 35 minutes
- Session 2: 1 hour 12 minutes
- Session 3: 47 minutes
- Pattern: VARIES based on free time

**Ghost Accounts:**
- Session 1: 45 minutes
- Session 2: 45 minutes
- Session 3: 45 minutes
- Pattern: EXACTLY 45 minutes, every time

**DETECTIVE**: "Always 45 minutes?"

**KASTOR**: "Every. Single. Time."

**DETECTIVE**: "That's definitely a program."

**KASTOR**: "Yep. Someone wrote a bot that:"
- Logs in every 3 hours
- Plays for exactly 45 minutes
- Wins 98% of games
- Then logs out

**Maya**: "But who? And why?"

**KASTOR**: "Let's find out. Kaito, can you pull the IP addresses for these accounts?"

**Kaito**: "On it!"

## Scene 3 — Following the Trail

**[Detective Office — Data Analysis]**

**Kaito**: (sends data) "Here are the IP addresses."

**KASTOR**: "Let me check where these accounts are logging in from..."

---

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #3: IP Addresses & VPNs

**KASTOR**: "Quick lesson! What's an IP address?"

**IP Address = Internet Address**
- Every device has one (like a house address)
- Shows the general location (country/city)
- Example: 203.0.113.45

**DETECTIVE**: "So we can find where the bots are?"

**KASTOR**: "Normally yes. But look at this..."

**Ghost Account IP Logs:**
```
Monday: USA (New York)
Tuesday: Germany (Berlin)
Wednesday: Japan (Tokyo)
Thursday: Brazil (São Paulo)
Friday: Australia (Sydney)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "They're all over the world?"

**KASTOR**: "In the same week. Nobody travels that fast."

**DETECTIVE**: "Then how...?"

**KASTOR**: "VPN. Virtual Private Network."

**What is a VPN?**
- Makes your internet connection appear to come from a different country
- Like wearing a mask that makes you look like you're somewhere else
- Used for privacy... or hiding your real location

**KASTOR**: "Whoever made these bots is using a VPN to hide where they really are."

**DETECTIVE**: "Smart."

**KASTOR**: "But they made a mistake."

---

### 🔍 The Critical Clue

**KASTOR**: "Look at the timestamps again."

```
3:00:00 AM — GhostKing_947 logs in from "USA"
3:00:00 AM — PhantomAce_12 logs in from "Germany"
3:00:00 AM — ShadowMaster_88 logs in from "Japan"
```

**DETECTIVE**: "They all log in at the exact same second?"

**KASTOR**: "Every. Single. Time."

**DETECTIVE**: "What does that mean?"

**KASTOR**: "It means ONE person is controlling ALL the bots."

**DETECTIVE**: "How?"

**KASTOR**: "They wrote a script — a program that:"
1. Logs into 247 accounts at once
2. Uses VPNs to fake different locations
3. Plays games automatically
4. Logs out after 45 minutes

**Kaito**: "247 accounts?!"

**KASTOR**: "Yep. Let's see when these accounts were created."

## Scene 4 — Account Creation Forensics

**KASTOR**: "Let's check the database. When were these ghost accounts created?"

---

### 📊 Account Creation Timeline

```
Date: 3 months ago
Time: 3:00 AM - 3:05 AM
Accounts Created: 247
Email Pattern: randomXXXX@tempmail.com
Referral Code: PROMO_GHOST (used 247 times)
Creator IP: [Hidden behind VPN]
```

**DETECTIVE**: "247 accounts in 5 minutes?"

**KASTOR**: "Automated script. No human types that fast."

**DETECTIVE**: "But how did they pass email verification?"

**KASTOR**: "Temporary email service. Disposable emails that work once, then vanish."

**Maya**: "But the referral code... that should have flagged our system!"

**KASTOR**: "It should. Unless..."

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #2 — Who Has This Power?

**KASTOR**: "Someone created a promo code that allows unlimited uses. Who would have that access?"

**A)** Regular player  
**B)** Game developer  
**C)** Security team  
**D)** Customer support

---

### [Player chooses C]

**KASTOR**: "Good thinking! Let's check who created the code."

**Admin Log:**
```
Promo Code: PROMO_GHOST
Created: 3 months ago
Creator: LA-SEC-001
Permission Level: Security Administrator
Unlimited Uses: YES
Description: "Marketing campaign test"
```

**DETECTIVE**: "LA-SEC-001?"

**Maya**: (checking) "That's... that's Elena Petrova."

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena? Our Head of Security?"

**KASTOR**: "We need to talk to her."

**Maya**: "She's... not here today. Called in sick."

**Kaito**: "She's been acting weird lately. Working late. Avoiding people."

**KASTOR**: "Detective, let's check the code repository. If Elena's involved, there might be more evidence."

## Scene 5 — The Hidden Backdoor

**[Examining the Ranking System Code]**

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at how rankings are calculated."

---

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #4: Reading Code

**KASTOR**: "You don't need to be a programmer to understand suspicious code. Let me show you."

**Normal Ranking Code:**
```javascript
function calculateRank(player) {
        let score = 0;
    
        // Add points for wins
        score = score + (player.wins * 10);
    
        // Subtract points for losses
        score = score - (player.losses * 5);
    
        return score;
}
```

**KASTOR**: "This is simple:"
- Win a game? +10 points
- Lose a game? -5 points
- Your total = your rank

**DETECTIVE**: "Makes sense."

**KASTOR**: "Now look at the ACTUAL code in the system..."

**Suspicious Code:**
```javascript
function calculateRank(player) {
        let score = 0;
    
        score = score + (player.wins * 10);
        score = score - (player.losses * 5);
    
        // ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS CODE BLOCK ⚠️
        if (player.isGhost === true) {
                score = score + 500;  // Extra boost!
        }
    
        // ⚠️ MORE SUSPICIOUS CODE ⚠️
        if (player.referralCode === "PROMO_GHOST") {
                score = score * 1.5;  // 50% multiplier!
        }
    
        return score;
}
```

**DETECTIVE**: "There's extra code!"

**KASTOR**: "See these two blocks?"

**Block 1: isGhost check**
- If account is marked as "ghost," add 500 bonus points
- No legitimate reason for this flag to exist

**Block 2: PROMO_GHOST check**
- If account used that referral code, multiply score by 1.5
- That's a 50% boost!

**DETECTIVE**: "So ghost accounts get +500 points AND a 50% multiplier?"

**KASTOR**: "That's why they jumped to the top so fast. They're not winning fairly — the system is rigged in their favor."

**Kaito**: "Who added this code?"

---

### 🔍 Code Commit History

**KASTOR**: "Let's check the commit history — the record of who changed the code."

```
Commit #7743
Date: 3 months ago
Author: elena.petrova@legendarena.com
Message: "Minor ranking adjustments"
Files Changed: ranking_system.js
Lines Added: 8 lines (the suspicious code blocks)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena added this three months ago?"

**KASTOR**: "Same time the ghost accounts were created."

**Maya**: (shocked) "Elena... why would she do this?"

**DETECTIVE**: "We need to talk to her. Now."

## Scene 6 — Elena's Story

**[Elena's Home — Evening]**

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena Petrova?"

**ELENA**: (opens door, looks tired) "Yes?"

**DETECTIVE**: "We're investigating the ghost accounts. We need to talk."

**ELENA**: (face goes pale) "...How did you find me?"

**KASTOR**: "The promo code. The code commits. The timeline. Everything points to you."

**ELENA**: (shoulders slump) "I knew someone would figure it out eventually."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why did you do it?"

**ELENA**: (long pause) "Can we... sit down?"

---

### 💔 The Manipulation

**[Living room — Elena makes tea with shaking hands]**

**ELENA**: "It started a year ago."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did?"

**ELENA**: "I met someone online. A gaming security forum. Username: CodeMaster_X."

**ELENA**: "We talked about security, programming, vulnerabilities. He seemed... so knowledgeable."

**KASTOR**: "Just technical talk?"

**ELENA**: (shakes head) "At first, yes. But then..."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #1: Building Trust

**ELENA**: "He started asking about my life. My work."

**ELENA**: "At Legend Arena, I... I wasn't happy."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why not?"

**ELENA**: "I was passed over for promotion. Twice."

**ELENA**: "I worked so hard. Longer hours than anyone. But they gave the position to someone else."

**ELENA**: "CodeMaster... he listened. He said I deserved better."

**ELENA**: "Nobody at work talked to me like that."

**KASTOR**: (to Detective, quietly) "This is how manipulation starts. Find someone vulnerable. Make them feel valued."

**ELENA**: "After a while, we talked every day."

**ELENA**: "He was the only person who seemed to care about me."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #2: The Request

**DETECTIVE**: "When did it change?"

**ELENA**: "Three months ago. He said... he knew a company."

**ELENA**: "A company that wanted to hire me. Better position. Better salary."

**ELENA**: "But I needed to prove myself first."

**DETECTIVE**: "How?"

**ELENA**: "He asked me to test Legend Arena's security."

**ELENA**: "Find vulnerabilities. Run tests. Show him what I could do."

**KASTOR**: "Did that seem suspicious?"

**ELENA**: "He said it was normal! Security professionals do penetration testing all the time!"

**ELENA**: "I just... I wanted that job so badly."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #3: Escalation

**ELENA**: "He asked me to create a few bot accounts. Just to test the system."

**ELENA**: "Then a few more. And more."

**ELENA**: "At first, I hesitated. But he said:"
> "If you can't do this simple test, how can I recommend you?"

**ELENA**: "So I created the PROMO_GHOST code. To let the accounts in."

**DETECTIVE**: "And the ranking boost code?"

**ELENA**: (crying now) "He sent me that. Said it was part of the test."

**ELENA**: "Said I needed to see if the company would notice."

**KASTOR**: "When did you realize something was wrong?"

---

### 💔 The Trap

**ELENA**: "When I said I wanted to stop."

**ELENA**: "He showed me... logs. Screenshots. Everything I'd done."

**ELENA**: "Then he said:"

> "You've already committed a crime, Elena.  
> If you don't finish the job, I'll report you.  
> You'll lose your job. Go to prison.  
> OR... you can install one more thing. Then we're done."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did he want you to install?"

**ELENA**: "A backdoor. Remote access to our core systems."

**ELENA**: (sobbing) "I was so scared. I didn't know what to do."

**ELENA**: "So I installed it."

**ELENA**: "And then... CodeMaster_X vanished."

**ELENA**: "Account deleted. All messages gone."

**ELENA**: "I've been terrified for months, waiting for someone to find out."

**ELENA**: "I tried to remove the backdoor, but I was afraid it would leave traces."

**ELENA**: "I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt the company."

---

### 🔍 Critical Question

**KASTOR**: "Elena, do you know who CodeMaster_X really is?"

**ELENA**: "No. I never saw a face. Just text messages."

**DETECTIVE**: "Email address?"

**ELENA**: "Anonymous service. Untraceable."

**KASTOR**: "Did they ever tell you why they wanted access to Legend Arena?"

**ELENA**: "No. I... I never asked."

**DETECTIVE**: (to Kastor) "This wasn't about rankings at all."

**KASTOR**: "No. Someone used Elena to get inside the system."

**DETECTIVE**: "But for what?"

## Scene 7 — The Real Damage

**[Legend Arena — Security Room, Next Day]**

**CAMILLE**: (junior security, on laptop) "I found the backdoor."

**Maya**: "Can you remove it?"

**CAMILLE**: "Already did. But... there's something worse."

---

### 📊 Data Forensics: Access Logs

**CAMILLE**: "Someone used the backdoor 47 times over the past three months."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did they do?"

**CAMILLE**: "They downloaded... player data."

**Maya**: "How much?"

**CAMILLE**: "50,000 accounts. Emails, usernames, game history, purchase records..."

**Maya**: "That's... our entire active player base."

**KASTOR**: "When was the last access?"

**CAMILLE**: "Two days ago. Right before Elena called in sick."

**DETECTIVE**: "They knew we were getting close."

---

### 💭 Pattern Recognition

**KASTOR**: "Look at the access times."

```
Access Log Pattern:
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
...
```

**KASTOR**: "Every access at exactly 3:00 AM."

**DETECTIVE**: "Same as the bot login times!"

**KASTOR**: "Same person. Same automation."

**Kaito**: "But Elena couldn't have done all this alone. She's not a programmer at that level."

**DETECTIVE**: "She was manipulated. Someone else is pulling the strings."

**Maya**: "Who? And why steal player data?"

**KASTOR**: "I don't know yet. But this feels... familiar."

---

### 🔍 Interactive Choice #3 — Connect the Dots

**KASTOR**: "Think back to Episode 1. What similarities do you see?"

**A)** Both cases involve someone at the company  
**B)** Both happened at Legend Arena  
**C)** Both feel like someone is testing us  
**D)** All of the above

---

### [Player chooses D]

**KASTOR**: "Exactly. Episode 1: Kaito manipulated his own stats. Simple."

**KASTOR**: "Episode 2: Elena manipulated by an unknown person. Complex."

**DETECTIVE**: "You think the same person is behind both?"

**KASTOR**: "Maybe. Or someone who's learning from Episode 1."

**DETECTIVE**: "Learning what?"

**KASTOR**: "How we investigate. What we look for. Our methods."

**DETECTIVE**: "That's... creepy."

**KASTOR**: "It's strategic. Like playing chess."

**KASTOR**: "And we're still several moves behind."

## Scene 8 — Consequences

**[One Week Later — Conference Room]**

**Maya**: "The board has made their decision."

**Maya**: "Elena... we have to let you go."

**ELENA**: "I understand."

**Maya**: "No criminal charges. But the trust is broken."

**ELENA**: "I know. I'm sorry, Maya."

**Maya**: "I'm sorry too. That you felt so undervalued."

**Maya**: "That someone used that against you."

---

### 💭 Lessons Learned

**[Detective Office]**

**DETECTIVE**: "Do you think Elena's a bad person?"

**KASTOR**: "No. I think she's a lonely person who made bad choices."

**DETECTIVE**: "The real villain is CodeMaster_X."

**KASTOR**: "Yes. But Elena still chose to install the backdoor."

**DETECTIVE**: "Because she was scared!"

**KASTOR**: "I know. Real life isn't simple."

**KASTOR**: "Good people can do bad things when they're manipulated."

**KASTOR**: "That's why understanding social engineering is so important."

---

### 📚 Key Lessons: Staying Safe Online

**KASTOR**: "Let's review what we learned from Elena's case."

**🚩 Red Flags in Online Relationships:**

1. **Someone understands you TOO perfectly**
    - Real friends take time to know you
    - Instant deep connection = manipulation tactic

2. **They isolate you from others**
    - "Nobody at your company appreciates you"
    - "I'm the only one who understands"
    - This makes you dependent on them

3. **They ask for small favors that escalate**
    - "Just test the system..."
    - "Just create a few accounts..."
    - "Just install this one thing..."
    - Each step seems small, but builds to crime

4. **They use fear to control you**
    - "I have evidence against you"
    - "You'll go to prison"
    - "You have no choice"
    - This is blackmail

**DETECTIVE**: "How do you avoid this?"

**KASTOR**: "Three rules:"

📌 **Rule 1: Verify Identity**
- Never fully trust online-only friends
- Ask for video calls, mutual connections
- If they refuse, be suspicious

📌 **Rule 2: Don't Mix Personal and Professional**
- Don't share work problems with strangers online
- Keep company information private
- Talk to real coworkers or friends instead

📌 **Rule 3: Stop at the First Illegal Request**
- If someone asks you to break rules, stop immediately
- Tell a trusted adult or supervisor
- Real opportunities don't require breaking laws

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena learned this the hard way."

**KASTOR**: "Yes. Let's make sure we don't."

**[Legend Arena — Next Week]**

**Maya**: "We're promoting Camille to Head of Security."

**CAMILLE**: "Me? But I'm only 24..."

**Maya**: "You found the backdoor. You understood the system."

**Maya**: "Elena was brilliant, but she needed recognition too much."

**Maya**: "You seem... more balanced."

**Maya**: "I won't let you down."

**[Someone knocks on the door]**

**???**: "Um, hello? I'm here for the interview..."

**DETECTIVE**: (looks up) "Alex?!"

**ALEX**: "Detective! Oh wow, you're here?"

**DETECTIVE**: "What are YOU doing here?"

**ALEX**: "I... after Episode 1, I got inspired."

**ALEX**: "I studied cybersecurity. Took online courses."

**ALEX**: "When I saw the news about ghost accounts, I thought..."

**ALEX**: "Maybe I could help?"

**KASTOR**: "ShadowFan99 from Episode 1? That Alex?"

**ALEX**: "Yeah! I'm the one who got caught up in Kaito's drama."

**Maya**: "You want to work in security now?"

**ALEX**: "I want to protect the game I love."

**ALEX**: "And maybe... help catch whoever's doing this."

**KASTOR**: (to Detective) "What do you think?"

**DETECTIVE**: "I think... people can change. Kaito proved that."

**Maya**: "Alright, Alex. You're hired. Junior position."

**ALEX**: "Thank you! I won't let you down!"

## Scene 10 — The Investigation Continues

**[Detective Office — Evening]**

**DETECTIVE**: "So... case closed?"

**KASTOR**: "Partially."

**KASTOR**: "We caught Elena. Removed the backdoor. Banned the bots."

**DETECTIVE**: "But?"

**KASTOR**: "CodeMaster_X is still out there."

**KASTOR**: "They have 50,000 player records."

**KASTOR**: "They manipulated Kaito in Episode 1."

**KASTOR**: "They manipulated Elena in Episode 2."

**KASTOR**: "Someone's running a long game."

**DETECTIVE**: "What do they want?"

**KASTOR**: "I don't know. But I have a feeling..."

**KASTOR**: "We'll find out in Episode 3."

**DETECTIVE**: "Should I be worried?"

**KASTOR**: "Worried? No."

**KASTOR**: "Prepared? Yes."

**KASTOR**: "Whoever this is... they're smart. Organized. Patient."
