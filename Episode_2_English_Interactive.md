**KASTOR**: "Drag each card to either BOT or HUMAN side!"

[Player classifies cards...]

**Correct Classification:**
```
BOTS (5):
- GhostKing_947
- User_7743
- Player_9521
- Account_HC3318
- Test_User_441

HUMANS (5):
- DragonKing_89
- xXShadowXx
- PixelMaster2k
- NinjaGirl_Luna
- ProGamer_OG
```

[Player gets 10/10 correct]

**KASTOR**: "PERFECT! Let me explain what you just spotted!"

**📊 BOT Red Flags:**
```
✓ Username Pattern: "User_XXXX", "Player_XXXX", "Account_XXXX"
  → Systematic naming = automated account creation

✓ Win Rate: 95-99% (unrealistic)
  → Even pros max out at 70%
  → Perfect performance = programmed

✓ Login Time: Exactly the same time every day
  → Humans are irregular
  → Bots follow schedules

✓ Account Age: All created ~3 months ago
  → Batch creation = coordinated attack

✓ Social Connections: 0 friends
  → Real players socialize
  → Bots don't make friends

✓ Games Played: Similar low numbers (47-52)
  → Suspicious similarity
```

**📊 HUMAN Characteristics:**
```
✓ Username: Personal, creative, unique
✓ Win Rate: 58-67% (realistic)
✓ Login Times: Irregular, follows life patterns
✓ Account Age: Varied (months to years)
✓ Friends: Many (23-342)
✓ Games Played: Highly varied
```

**DETECTIVE**: "So all the bot accounts were created at the same time?"

**KASTOR**: "Within days of each other. Classic bot farm pattern."

🎵 **+40 POINTS** — Bot Hunter Badge Earned! 🤖

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson Unlocked: Pattern Recognition**
```
When analyzing accounts, look for:
1. Systematic patterns (too perfect = suspicious)
2. Outliers (one weird thing might be chance, multiple = intentional)
3. Temporal clustering (all created same time = coordinated)
4. Missing social signals (humans leave traces everywhere)
```

## Scene 2 — Behavior Patterns

**KASTOR**: "Good job! But let's go deeper. Let's look at WHEN these bots play."

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #2: Login Patterns

[Interactive Graph — Login Times Over 7 Days]

**Normal Player (DragonKing_89) Login Times:**
```
[Graph showing random spikes]
Mon: 8pm-11pm

Thu: 9pm-midnight
Fri: 6pm-1am (weekend starts!)
Sat: 11am-2pm, 8pm-11pm (two sessions)
Sun: 3pm-9pm

Pattern: IRREGULAR, follows human life
```

**Ghost Account (GhostKing_947) Login Times:**
```
[Graph showing perfect intervals]
Mon: 03:00:00, 06:00:00, 09:00:00, 12:00:00

Sun: 03:00:00, 06:00:00, 09:00:00, 12:00:00

Pattern: EXACTLY every 3 hours, like clockwork
```

**DETECTIVE**: "They log in every three hours? Exactly?"

**KASTOR**: "Down to the same SECOND. 03:00:00.000"

**KAITO**: "That's... not human."

**KASTOR**: "Humans are messy. We don't do things at exactly the same time every day."

**KASTOR**: "But I noticed something else interesting..."

---

## Scene 3 — Network Connections + 🎮 MINI-GAME 2.2

**KASTOR**: "247 bot accounts. Let's see where they're logging in from."

**KAITO**: *pulls up data* "Here are the IP addresses."

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #3: IP Addresses & Clustering

**KASTOR**: "Quick reminder! What's an IP address?"

**IP Address = Internet Address**
- Every device has one (like a house address)
- Shows general location (country/city)
- Example: 192.168.1.100

**DETECTIVE**: "So we can find where the bots are?"

**KASTOR**: "Let's find out! But here's where it gets interesting..."

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 2.2: "IP Network Map" (Network Clustering)

**KASTOR**: "I need your help connecting the dots — literally!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Find which bot accounts share the same IP address. Connect them with lines to reveal clusters!

[Network Graph Display - 15 Nodes (Bot Accounts)]

**Instructions:**
```
1. Click on any account node to see its IP address
2. Click two nodes to draw a connection line
3. If they share the same IP → Blue line (correct!)
4. If different IPs → Red line (wrong, line disappears)
5. Find all 3 clusters!
```

[15 Account Nodes Displayed]

**Player clicks on User_7743:**
```
Username: User_7743
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Device: Desktop-Chrome
Location: Seoul, South Korea
```

**Player clicks on Player_9521:**
```
Username: Player_9521
IP Address: 192.168.1.100 ← SAME!
Device: Desktop-Chrome
Location: Seoul, South Korea
```

[Player connects them → BLUE LINE appears!]

**KASTOR**: "Nice! They share an IP! Keep going!"

[Player continues clicking and connecting...]

**Final Network Map:**
```
CLUSTER A (IP: 192.168.1.100) - 5 accounts:
├─ User_7743
├─ Player_9521
├─ Account_HC3318
├─ Test_User_441
└─ GhostKing_947

CLUSTER B (IP: 10.0.0.55) - 4 accounts:
├─ Player_WB8821
├─ User_3312
├─ Account_DF7821
└─ Test_9944

CLUSTER C (IP: 172.16.0.88) - 6 accounts:
├─ Bot_Final_1
├─ Bot_Final_2
├─ Bot_Final_3
├─ Bot_Final_4
├─ Bot_Final_5
└─ Bot_Final_6
```

[Player successfully identifies all 3 clusters!]

**KASTOR**: "BRILLIANT! Look at what you found!"

**DETECTIVE**: "Three groups... three different IPs?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! But here's the twist:"

**KASTOR**: "All 247 bot accounts trace back to only **3 IP addresses**!"

**DETECTIVE**: "So one person is running multiple accounts from each location?"

**KASTOR**: "Or... one person running ALL accounts from 3 different servers."

🎵 **+45 POINTS** — Network Detective Badge Earned! 🌐

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson Unlocked: Network Analysis**
```
Clustering reveals:
1. Shared resources (same IP = same source)
2. Scale of operation (247 accounts, 3 IPs = organized)
3. Infrastructure patterns (server farms, not individuals)
4. Coordination (all working together, not independent)
```

**MAYA**: "But wait... if we have the IP addresses, can't we just block them?"

**KASTOR**: "We could, but..."

**KASTOR**: "I want to find out WHO is behind this first."

**KASTOR**: "Let's look at the code that's running the ranking system."

## Scene 4 — The Hidden Backdoor + 🎮 MINI-GAME 2.3

**[Camille enters]**

**CAMILLE**: "I can help with that. After the last incident, I've been auditing all our code."

**DETECTIVE**: "Camille! Good to see you!"

**CAMILLE**: "Likewise. Maya asked me to join the security team after... Elena."

**KASTOR**: "Perfect timing. Can you pull up the ranking calculation code?"

**CAMILLE**: "Already have it."

---

### 📊 Data Literacy Lesson #4: Reading Code (Without Programming!)

**KASTOR**: "You don't need to be a programmer to spot suspicious code. Let me teach you."

**Normal Ranking Code:**
```javascript
function calculateRank(player) {
    let score = 0;

    // Add points for wins
    score = score + (player.wins * 10);

    // Subtract points for losses
    score = score - (player.losses * 5);

    return score;
}
```

**KASTOR**: "This is simple logic:"
- Win a game? Get +10 points
- Lose a game? Lose -5 points
- Your total score = your rank

**DETECTIVE**: "That makes sense."

**KASTOR**: "Now look at the ACTUAL code in the system..."

---

### 🎮 MINI-GAME 2.3: "Code Treasure Hunt" (Finding the Backdoor)

**KASTOR**: "Time for the ultimate challenge!"

**🎯 Your Mission**: Find the 3 suspicious lines in this code. Mark lines that don't belong!

[Code Editor Display - 30 Lines of JavaScript]

```javascript
1.  function calculateRank(player) {
2.      let score = 0;
3.
4.      // Add points for wins
5.      score = score + (player.wins * 10);
6.
7.      // Subtract points for losses
8.      score = score - (player.losses * 5);
9.
10.     // Apply bonus for premium members
11.     if (player.premium === true) {
12.         score = score * 1.2;  // 20% boost
13.     }
14.
15.     // ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS CODE BLOCK #1 ⚠️
16.     if (player.accountType === "ghost") {
17.         score = score + 500;  // Massive boost!
18.     }
19.
20.     // Calculate final ranking position
21.     let rank = calculatePosition(score);
22.
23.     // ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS CODE BLOCK #2 ⚠️
24.     if (player.referralCode === "PROMO_GHOST") {
25.         score = score * 1.5;  // 50% multiplier!
26.     }
27.
28.     // Apply time-based bonuses
29.     if (player.playtime > 100) {
30.         score = score + 50;
31.     }
32.
33.     // ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS CODE BLOCK #3 ⚠️
34.     if (player.creator === "elena.kovac@legendarena.com") {
35.         score = score + 10000;  // Huge boost!
36.     }
37.
38.     return score;
39. }
```

**Instructions:**
```
Click the "?" button next to each line to get Kastor's explanation
Click the "🚩" button to flag a line as suspicious
Find all 3 suspicious blocks!
```

[Player clicks "?" on Line 5]

**KASTOR**: "This is normal! Wins give points. Every game does this."

[Player clicks "?" on Line 16-18]

**KASTOR**: "WHOA! This gives 500 bonus points to accounts marked as 'ghost'? Why would that flag even exist?!"

[Player flags Line 16-18 as suspicious! 🚩]

**KASTOR**: "Good eye! That's definitely suspicious! Keep looking!"

[Player clicks "?" on Line 24-26]

**KASTOR**: "This gives a 50% score multiplier to anyone who used the 'PROMO_GHOST' referral code. Combined with the +500 boost? These accounts would skyrocket to the top!"

[Player flags Line 24-26 as suspicious! 🚩]

**KASTOR**: "Two down, one more to go!"

[Player clicks "?" on Line 34-36]

**KASTOR**: "Holy... This gives 10,000 points to accounts created by elena.kovac@legendarena.com?! That's an employee email!"

[Player flags Line 34-36 as suspicious! 🚩]

**KASTOR**: "YOU FOUND THEM ALL!"

---

### The Backdoor Explained

**KASTOR**: "Let's break down what we found:"

**Suspicious Block #1 (Lines 16-18):**
```
if (player.accountType === "ghost") {
    score = score + 500;
}
```
- Gives +500 bonus points to "ghost" accounts
- No legitimate reason for this flag
- Hidden advantage

**Suspicious Block #2 (Lines 24-26):**
```
if (player.referralCode === "PROMO_GHOST") {
    score = score * 1.5;
}
```
- 50% score multiplier for PROMO_GHOST code
- Combined with Block #1: +500 points THEN ×1.5
- Double boosting!

**Suspicious Block #3 (Lines 34-36):**
```
if (player.creator === "elena.kovac@legendarena.com") {
    score = score + 10000;
}
```
- Massive 10,000 point boost
- Tied to a specific employee
- Personal backdoor!

**DETECTIVE**: "So these three code blocks make ghost accounts jump to the top?"

**KASTOR**: "Exactly! Normal player: 100 points. Ghost account: (100 + 500) × 1.5 + 10000 = **10,900 points**!"

**MAYA**: "Who added this code?"

**CAMILLE**: *checking commit history* "Let me see..."

Reviewer: None (bypassed review!)
```

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena Kovac?"

**MAYA**: *shocked* "That's... Elena Petrova. Our Head of Security."

**KASTOR**: "We need to talk to her. Now."

🎵 **+50 POINTS** — Code Sleuth Badge Earned! 💻

**📊 Data Literacy Lesson Unlocked: Code Analysis**
```
You don't need to code to spot suspicious logic:
1. Look for special cases (if statements targeting specific users)
2. Look for unrealistic bonuses (10,000 points is absurd)
3. Look for hidden flags (why does "ghost" type exist?)
4. Check who wrote it (insider access)
```

---

## Scene 5 — Elena's Story

**[Elena's Home — Evening]**

**DETECTIVE**: "Elena Petrova?"

**ELENA**: *opens door, looks exhausted* "Yes?"

**DETECTIVE**: "We're investigating the ghost accounts. We need to talk."

**ELENA**: *face goes pale* "...How did you find me?"

**KASTOR**: "The promo code. The code commits. The timeline. Everything points to you."

**ELENA**: *shoulders slump* "I knew someone would figure it out eventually."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why did you do it?"

**ELENA**: *long pause* "Can we... sit down?"

---

### 💔 The Manipulation

**[Living room — Elena's hands shake as she speaks]**

**ELENA**: "It started a year ago."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did?"

**ELENA**: "I met someone online. A gaming security forum. Username: CodeMaster_X."

**ELENA**: "We talked about security, programming, vulnerabilities. He seemed... so knowledgeable."

**KASTOR**: "Just technical talk?"

**ELENA**: "At first, yes. But then..."

**ELENA**: "He started asking about my life. My work."

**ELENA**: "At Legend Arena, I... I wasn't happy."

**DETECTIVE**: "Why not?"

**ELENA**: "I was passed over for promotion. Twice."

**ELENA**: "I worked so hard. Longer hours than anyone. But they gave the position to someone else."

**ELENA**: "CodeMaster... he listened. He said I deserved better."

**ELENA**: "Nobody at work talked to me like that."

**KASTOR**: *quietly to Detective* "This is how manipulation starts. Find someone vulnerable. Make them feel valued."

**ELENA**: "After a while, we talked every day."

**ELENA**: "He was the only person who seemed to care about me."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #1: Building Trust

**KASTOR**: *narrating for Detective*

**Stage 1: Reconnaissance**
```
✓ Find lonely/frustrated target
✓ Identify their pain points (Elena: passed over for promotion)
✓ Approach through shared interests (security forums)
```

**Stage 2: Build Rapport**
```
✓ Daily conversations
✓ Validate their expertise ("You're so knowledgeable!")
✓ Amplify workplace grievances ("They don't appreciate you")
✓ Become their only confidant
```

**Stage 3: Create Dependency**
```
✓ "I'm the only one who understands you"
✓ Isolate from coworkers
✓ Make yourself essential to their emotional wellbeing
```

---

**DETECTIVE**: "When did it change?"

**ELENA**: "Three months ago. He said... he knew a company."

**ELENA**: "A company that wanted to hire me. Better position. Better salary."

**ELENA**: "But I needed to prove myself first."

**DETECTIVE**: "How?"

**ELENA**: "He asked me to test Legend Arena's security."

**ELENA**: "Find vulnerabilities. Run tests. Show him what I could do."

**KASTOR**: "Did that seem suspicious?"

**ELENA**: "He said it was normal! Security professionals do penetration testing all the time!"

**ELENA**: "I just... I wanted that job so badly."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #2: Escalation

**KASTOR**: *explaining to Detective*

**Stage 4: Small Requests**
```
✓ "Just create a few test accounts" (seems harmless)
✓ "Just add a promo code for testing" (still sounds professional)
✓ "Just tweak the ranking formula" (now getting illegal)
```

**The Psychology:**
- Each step seems small
- Each step builds on the last
- By the time it's clearly wrong, you're already complicit
- Sunk cost fallacy: "I've come this far..."

---

**ELENA**: "He asked me to create a few bot accounts. Just to test the system."

**ELENA**: "Then a few more. And more."

**ELENA**: "At first, I hesitated. But he said:"
> "If you can't do this simple test, how can I recommend you?"

**ELENA**: "So I created the PROMO_GHOST code. To let the accounts in."

**DETECTIVE**: "And the ranking boost code?"

**ELENA**: *crying now* "He sent me that. Said it was part of the test."

**ELENA**: "Said I needed to see if the company would notice."

**KASTOR**: "When did you realize something was wrong?"

---

### 💔 The Trap

**ELENA**: "When I said I wanted to stop."

**ELENA**: "He showed me... logs. Screenshots. Everything I'd done."

**ELENA**: "Then he said:"

> "You've already committed a crime, Elena.
> If you don't finish the job, I'll report you.
> You'll lose your job. Go to prison.
> OR... you can install one more thing. Then we're done."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did he want you to install?"

**ELENA**: "A backdoor. Remote access to our core systems."

**ELENA**: *sobbing* "I was so scared. I didn't know what to do."

**ELENA**: "So I installed it."

**ELENA**: "And then... CodeMaster_X vanished."

**ELENA**: "Account deleted. All messages gone."

**ELENA**: "I've been terrified for months, waiting for someone to find out."

**ELENA**: "I tried to remove the backdoor, but I was afraid it would leave traces."

**ELENA**: "I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt the company."

---

### 📊 Social Engineering Lesson #3: The Trap

**KASTOR**: *explaining to Detective*

**Stage 5: Blackmail**
```
✓ Collect evidence of victim's crimes
✓ Present ultimatum: "Continue or I expose you"
✓ Victim feels trapped (already guilty, nowhere to go)
✓ Extract final payload (backdoor, data, money)
```

**Stage 6: Disappear**
```
✓ Delete all communication
✓ Leave victim holding the bag
✓ Use stolen access for real objective
```

**The Result:**
- Victim is scared, guilty, alone
- Manipulator has what they wanted
- Victim takes all the blame

## Scene 6 — The Real Damage

**[Legend Arena — Security Room, Next Day]**

**CAMILLE**: *on laptop* "I found the backdoor."

**MAYA**: "Can you remove it?"

**CAMILLE**: "Already did. But... there's something worse."

**CAMILLE**: "Someone used the backdoor 47 times over the past three months."

**DETECTIVE**: "What did they do?"

**CAMILLE**: "They downloaded... player data."

**MAYA**: "How much?"

**CAMILLE**: "50,000 accounts. Emails, usernames, game history, purchase records..."

**MAYA**: "That's... our entire active player base."

**KASTOR**: "When was the last access?"

**CAMILLE**: "Two days ago. Right before Elena called in sick."

**DETECTIVE**: "They knew we were getting close."

**KASTOR**: "Look at the access times."

```
Access Log Pattern:
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
03:00:00 AM — Data download (500 accounts)
...
```

**KASTOR**: "Every access at exactly 3:00 AM."

**DETECTIVE**: "Same as the bot login times!"

### 🚩 Red Flags in Online Relationships

**KASTOR**: "Let's review what we learned from Elena's case."

**1. Someone understands you TOO perfectly**
- Real friends take time to know you
- Instant deep connection = manipulation tactic

**2. They isolate you from others**
- "Nobody at your company appreciates you"
- "I'm the only one who understands"
- This makes you dependent on them

**3. They ask for small favors that escalate**
- "Just test the system..."
- "Just create a few accounts..."
- "Just install this one thing..."
- Each step seems small, but builds to crime

**4. They use fear to control you**
- "I have evidence against you"
- "You'll go to prison"
- "You have no choice"
- This is blackmail

**DETECTIVE**: "How do you avoid this?"

**KASTOR**: "Three rules:"

📌 **Rule 1: Verify Identity**
- Never fully trust online-only friends
- Ask for video calls, mutual connections
- If they refuse, be suspicious

📌 **Rule 2: Don't Mix Personal and Professional**
- Don't share work problems with strangers online
- Keep company information private
- Talk to real coworkers or friends instead

📌 **Rule 3: Stop at the First Illegal Request**
- If someone asks you to break rules, stop immediately
- Tell a trusted adult or supervisor
- Real opportunities don't require breaking laws
